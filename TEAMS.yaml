# This is a YAML file mapping team aliases from GitHub to
# metadata about the team.
# Expected structure is available in pkg/internal/team/team.go.

# Finding triage_column_id:
#   TriageColumnID is the column id of the project column the team uses to
#   triage issues. To get it, open the project, click the "..." on top of
#   the project column, and click "Copy column link". That link contains
#   the ID as the `#column-<ID>` fragment.
#
# You can also use:
#   https://github.com/cockroachlabs/github-find-triage-column-id using
#   `go install github.com/cockroachlabs/github-find-triage-column-id@latest`.
#
#   Then to retrieve triage_column_id from a repo-based project, run:
#     github-get-column-id --repo "cockroach" --project "Bazel" --column "To do"
#   Or retrieve the triage_column_id from a organization-based project, run:
#     github-get-column-id --project "Spatial" --column "Backlog"
