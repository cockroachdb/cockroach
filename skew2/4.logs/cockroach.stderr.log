* WARNING: ALL SECURITY CONTROLS HAVE BEEN DISABLED!
* 
* This mode is intended for non-production testing only.
* 
* In this mode:
* - Your cluster is open to any client that can access any of your IP addresses.
* - Intruders with access to your machine or network can observe client-server traffic.
* - Intruders can log in without password and read or write any data in the cluster.
* - Intruders can consume all your server's resources and cause unavailability.
*
*
* INFO: To start a secure server without mandating TLS for clients,
* consider --accept-sql-without-tls instead. For other options, see:
* 
* - https://go.crdb.dev/issue-v/53404/dev
* - https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/dev/secure-a-cluster.html
*
*
* WARNING: Running a server without --sql-addr, with a combined RPC/SQL listener, is deprecated.
* This feature will be removed in a later version of CockroachDB.
*
*
* INFO: initial startup completed.
* Node will now attempt to join a running cluster, or wait for `cockroach init`.
* Client connections will be accepted after this completes successfully.
* Check the log file(s) for progress.
