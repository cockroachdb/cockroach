// A Subscription is used to receive events from a specific Feed. A Subscription
// should only be instantiated via a call to a Feed's Subscribe() method. Once
// created, events can be read directly from the Events channel provided by this
// structure.
//
// An example of a typical usage of a Subscription:
//
//		subscriber := feed.Subscribe()
//		for event := range subscriber.Events() {
//			// Process event...
//		}
//
// A Subscription cannot block other Subscriptions to the same feed, and each
// Subscription will receive all events published by the Feed. The user of a
// Subscription should not modify Events received over the channel.
//
// A Subscription can be closed via the Unsubscribe() method, which will result
// in the Events channel being closed. The Events channel will also be closed if
// the Feed itself is closed.

// Entries are published by via the Publish method of the Feed; this cannot be
// blocked by Subscriber activities and will always return quickly.  Subscribers
// receive events by reading from their Events channel.
//
// A Feed can be initialized by simply instantiating an empty feed object:
//
//		feed := &Feed{}
//		subscriber := feed.Subscribe()
//		feed.Publish(someEvent())
//
// The Feed does not keep historical events; individual Subscribers will only
// receive events published after they Subscribe. Events can be published to a
// Feed until its Close() method is called.
//
// The non-blocking property of the feed is achieved by giving each Subscriber's
// Events channel a very large buffer. If a Subscriber does not read from its
// channel, then its buffer will fill; if a call to Publish() attempts to write
// to a full Subscriber channel, it will panic.
