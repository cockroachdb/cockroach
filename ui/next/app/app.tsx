/**
 * UI/NEXT TODO LIST
 *
 * ! = Potentially difficult to implement
 *
 * - Visualization Components
 *    - Graphs
 *      - Greyed-out display on error
 *    - Cluster health indicator
 * ! Notification Banners
 *    - Cockroach out of date
 * - Node Page
 *    ! Logs Page
 * - Layout Footer
 * ! HelpUs communication with CRL server
 *
 *
 * NICE TO HAVE:
 *  - "generateCacheReducer()" method; most of our data reducers are extremely
 *  similar (storing read-only, cachable data queried from the server), we could
 *  cut down on a lot of boilerplate and testing by creating such a function.
 *
 *  - Create a "NodeStatusProvider" similar to "MetricsDataProvider", allowing
 *  different components to access nodes data.
 *
 *  - Commonize code between different graph types (LineGraph and
 *  StackedAreaGraph). This can likely be done by converting them into stateless
 *  functions, that return an underlying "Common" graph component. The props of
 *  the Common graph component would include the part of `initGraph` and
 *  `drawGraph` that are different for these two chart types.
 *
 *  - It is possible to create race conditions using the time scale selector.
 *  The issue: a user selects a new time scale, which immediately initiates a
 *  server query. Before that query completes, change the time scale again,
 *  initiating another query to the server. The order in which these queries
 *  complete is indeterminate, and could result in the charts displaying data
 *  for the wrong time scale.
