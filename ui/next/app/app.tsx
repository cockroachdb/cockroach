/**
 * UI/NEXT TODO LIST
 *
 * ! = Potentially difficult to implement
 *
 * - Visualization Components
 *    - Graphs
 *      - Greyed-out display on error
 *      - Stacked Line Graph
 *      - Max/Min aggregators
 *    ! Events table
 *    ! Global Timespan Selector
 *      - UI Component
 *      - Reducer for current global timespan
 *    - Cluster health indicator
 * ! Notification Banners
 *    - Help Us
 *    - Cluster Unreachable
 *    - Cockroach out of date
 * - Cluster Page
 *    - Events page
 * - Nodes Page
 *    - Graphs tab, with all graphs from existing page
 * - Node Page
 *    - Overview page with table
 *    - Graphs page
 *    ! Logs Page
 * ! Databases Page
 *    - Database table
 *    - Tables drilldown
 *    - Table drilldown
 * ! HelpUs Page
 *    - Forms
 *    - Reducer
 * ! HelpUs Modal
 * ! Persistent Settings Reducer
 * - Layout Footer
 *
 *
 * NICE TO HAVE:
 *  - "generateCacheReducer()" method; most of our data reducers are extremely
 *  similar (storing read-only, cachable data queried from the server), we could
 *  cut down on a lot of boilerplate and testing by creating such a function.
 *  
 *  - Create a "NodeStatusProvider" similar to "MetricsDataProvider", allowing
 *  different components to access nodes data.
