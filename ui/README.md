# Embedded UI

This directory contains the client-side code for cockroach's web admin console.
These files are embedded into the cockroach binary via the
[go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) package, which is used to
generate the `embedded.go` file in this directory.

## Modification
If any modifications are made to the contents of this directory, run `make`
in this directory to generate a new `embedded.go`, which should _then be
committed along with the original files_. The generated file is committed
because making our web admin resource requires [additional non-go
dependencies](#dependencies)

## Development
While actively developing the user interface, use `make debug` in order to run
go-bindata in debug mode.  This will instruct go-bindata to proxy your local
files (rather than using embedded versions) so you'll be able to edit them live
without recompiling or restarting the server.

For this change to be picked up, you'll need to run `make build` in the project root.

Note that only those files that were present the last time you ran `make debug`
will be proxied; if you add a new file, you must run recompile and restart the
server after running `make debug`.

Before committing, be sure to run `make` to generate a non-debug version of
`embedded.go`. This is enforced by our build system, but forgetting to do this
will result in wasted time waiting for the build.

## Dependencies
Our admin UI is compiled using a collection of tools that depends on
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/), so you'll want to have that installed.

We use npm to manage various dependencies; be sure that your node installation
includes a recent version of npm. If you observe problems with npm, try updating
it using `npm install -g npm`.

We use Bower to manage frontend dependencies and Typings to manage typescript
definition files.
Our Makefile automatically installs these tools locally, so for the most part,
you can be blissfully ignorant of their use. However, if you wish to add
Bower/Typings dependencies (and do not have your own opinions on binstubs), you'll
want to run them from the local install using one of:
- `node_modules/.bin/bower install --save <myAwesomeDep>`
- `node_modules/.bin/typings install --save <myAwesomeDep>`

To modify an existing npm dependency, you'll need to edit `package.json` in the
standard fashion, while to add a new npm dependency, you'll want to run:

```
	npm install --save <myAwesomeDep>
```

Either way, complete any npm changes by running:
```
	rm -r node_modules && npm update && node_modules/.bin/shonkwrap
```

Be sure to commit any changes to `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

The `--save` modifier and `shonkwrap` invocation above are necessary to properly
lock down dependencies for other developers on the project, so make sure you don't
elide them!
