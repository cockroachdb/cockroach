/**
 * HACK
 *
 * These enumerations are copied due to an incompatibility between two tools in
 * our system:
 *
 * 1. The systemJS typescript loader (frankwallis/plugin-typescript) compiles
 * files using typescript's "single file compilation" mode, which is unable to
 * resolve ambiently declared const enums:
 *
 *     https://github.com/frankwallis/plugin-typescript/issues/89
 *
 * 2. The Proto2Typescript generator (SINTEF-9012/Proto2TypeScript) outputs
 * enumerations as ambiently declared const enums in a .d.ts file:
 *
 *    https://github.com/SINTEF-9012/Proto2TypeScript/issues/4
 *
 * Unfortunately, it is not trivial to change either of these behaviors; the
 * plugin-typescript behavior is unfixable (fundamentally incompatible with its
 * current basic strategy), while the Proto2Typescript generated file would need
 * to be changed dramatically; specifically, it would need generate an
 * importable module format (rather than its current design of declaring ambient
 * global objects).
 *
 * As an aside, it is possible we will eventually stop using Proto2TypeScript:
 *
 *     https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/6616
