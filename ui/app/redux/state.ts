       * The state object insn't currently serializeable, which redux dev tools
       * expects, because there's a an issue with the path
       * state.cachedData.nodes.data[...].metrics.field. Redux-dev-tools should
       * be using jsan, which should be able to handle ciruclar references, but
       * something about the generated ProtoBufMap type is breaking it. It will
       * take some time to construct an example that appropriately demonstrates
       * why ProtoBufMap breaks jsan which will be necessary to file issues for
       * those libraries.
       *
       * TODO (maxlang): Create an example demonstrating ProtoBufMap breaking
       * jsan and file issues upstream.
       *
       * Current fix inspired by this suggestion for avoiding large blobs in
       * redux dev tools:
       * https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/issues/159#issuecomment-231034408

       * opened.
