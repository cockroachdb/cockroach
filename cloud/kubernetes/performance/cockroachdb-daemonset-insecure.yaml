# Generated file, DO NOT EDIT. Source: cloud/kubernetes/templates/performance/cockroachdb-daemonset-insecure.yaml
# This configuration file sets up a DaemonSet running CockroachDB in insecure
# mode. For more information on why you might want to use a DaemonSet instead
# of a StatefulSet, see our docs:
# https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/kubernetes-performance.html#running-in-a-daemonset
#
# To use this file, customize the parts labeled "TODO" before running:
#   kubectl create -f cockroachdb-daemonset-insecure.yaml
#
# Initialize the cluster by picking one of the CockroachDB pod names from
# the output of `kubectl get pods`, then run:
#   kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ./cockroach init --insecure
#
# If you're interested in using a DaemonSet in secure mode instead, please see
# cockroachdb-daemonset-secure.yaml.
