# Generated file, DO NOT EDIT. Source: cloud/kubernetes/templates/performance/cockroachdb-statefulset-secure.yaml
# This configuration file sets up a secure StatefulSet running CockroachDB with
# tweaks to make it more performant than our default configuration files. All
# changes from the default secure configuration have been marked with a comment
# starting with "NOTE" or "TODO".
#
# To use it, customize all the parts of the file labeled "TODO" before running:
#   kubectl create -f cockroachdb-statefulset-secure.yaml
#
# You will then have to approve certificate-signing requests and initialize the
# cluster as described in the parent directory's README.md file.
#
# If you don't see any pods being created, it's possible that your cluster was
# not able to meet the resource requests asked for, whether it was the amount
# of CPU, memory, or disk or the disk type. To find information about why pods
# haven't been created, you can run:
#   kubectl get events
#
# For more information on improving CockroachDB performance in Kubernetes, see
# our docs:
