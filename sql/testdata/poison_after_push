# not immediately poisoned when it revisits a Range on which one of
# its intents has had its timestamp pushed. This allows it to continue
# laying down intents in a single pass, despite the certainty that it
# will restart on commit. A SNAPSHOT transaction can proceed and
# commit with its new timestamp.
