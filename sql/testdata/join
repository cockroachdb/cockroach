# The join condition logic is tricky to get right with NULL
# values. Simple implementations can deal well with NULLs on the first
# or last row but fail to handle them in the middle. So the test table
# must contain at least 3 rows with a null in the middle. This test
# table also contains the pair 44/42 so that a test with a non-trivial
# ON condition can be written.
