# Typically only one bazel server can be running in one output_base at
# a time, which means if we always use the default base, only one bazel server 
# can be running for a given workspace at a time. Instead, we'll keep a few 
# output bases and claim an available one as needed to allow concurrent runs.
#
# If we run out of bases and fall back to the default, or somehow end up handing
# the same base to two runs, bazel will resort to queuing on its own locking 
# meaning this claim system is not important to correctness and is just here to
# make life easier during development.
#
# If this script successfully claims a base, it will export the its path in the 
# var BAZEL_OUTPUT_BASE, and install an EXIT trap to release it. Scripts which
# call this script should thus avoid using `exec` as that prevents the cleanup
# trap from running as it replaces the entire process.

# If a base has already been claimed, there's nothing more to do.
