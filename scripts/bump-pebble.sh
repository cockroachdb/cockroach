# storage team bumps CockroachDB's Pebble dependency frequently, and this script
# automates some of that work.

# To bump the Pebble dependency to the corresponding pebble branch HEAD, run:
#
#   ./scripts/bump-pebble.sh [<pebble-sha>]
#
# If <pebble-sha> is not provided, the latest sha on $PEBBLE_BRANCH is used.
#
# The script must be run from the cockroach repo root, and the repo should be up
# to date. If $BRANCH is checked out, the script first creates a new branch and
# checks it out. Otherwise, the current branch is used.
