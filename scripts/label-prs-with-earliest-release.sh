# As we want to get all the log information based in 2 different git-ref within the git history, we are using
# git log command as it was the easiest way to accomplish this.
# We are using the below git log arguments:
# --merges: As we only wants to fetch (or print) merge commits.
# --reverse: Show the choosen commits in reverse order (By default, the commits are shown in reverse chronological order).
# --oneline: Shorthand for "--pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit" used together. Only shows prefix and uses 80 characters.
# --ancestry-path: Only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the 2 SHA references.
# --format: Using explicitly, so we don't rely on the default git log format. https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats.
