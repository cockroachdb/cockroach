Takes profiles or runtime traces in a loop. For endpoints that don't
block, fetches at 1s intervals.

See https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof for details.

Usage:

$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/allocs'
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/heap'
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/mutex'
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/goroutine'

# not sampled by default; need COCKROACH_BLOCK_PROFILE_RATE
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/block'

# allocs within the last 3s.
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/allocs?seconds=3'

# 3s runtime traces
$0 'http://localhost:8080/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=3'

# 3s CPU profiles
