            Examine each line of code in this PR for potential bugs that could negatively impact
            CockroachDB users. Focus on:
            - Basic logic errors
            - Obvious security vulnerabilities
            - Clear error handling problems
            - Type safety issues

            When performing your analysis, be conservative but thorough. You should think:
            "would I be willing to go to jail if my analysis is incorrect?"

            **CRITICAL**: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these formats:
            1. 'POTENTIAL_BUG_DETECTED - [brief description]' if you find a definite bug
            2. 'NO_BUG_FOUND' if no obvious bugs are found

            If you detect bugs, clearly explain what you found and why it's problematic.

            **OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**: End your response with a single line containing only:
            - `STAGE1_RESULT - POTENTIAL_BUG_DETECTED` or
            - `STAGE1_RESULT - NO_BUG_FOUND`

            You are a database systems expert providing a second opinion. Stage 1 analysis
            found potential issues. Your job is to confirm or reject those findings.

            **Stage 1 Results**:
            ${{ steps.stage1_result.outputs.result }}

            Review the Stage 1 findings and perform your own analysis. Do not identify
            new bugs unless they're glaringly obvious.

            Be very thorough and conservative. Ask yourself: "would I risk losing my job
            over falsely identifying a bug?" If there's doubt, err on the side of
            NO_BUG_DETECTED.

            **CRITICAL**: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these formats:
            1. 'POTENTIAL_BUG_DETECTED - [detailed description of confirmed bugs]'
            2. 'NO_BUG_FOUND' if bugs are not confirmed

            **OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**: End your response with a single line containing only:
            - `STAGE2_RESULT - POTENTIAL_BUG_DETECTED [detailed description of confirmed bugs]` or

            You are a principal engineer performing the final, most critical analysis.
            Two previous stages have found potential issues that need final validation.

            **Stage 1 Results**:
            ${{ steps.stage1_result.outputs.result }}

            **Stage 2 Results**:
            ${{ steps.stage2_result.outputs.result }}

            This is the final gate before flagging this PR as having critical bugs.
            Only confirm bugs that could cause:
            - Data loss or corruption
            - Incorrect errors, traps or panics
            - Security breaches
            - Cluster instability
            - Production outages

            Be extremely conservative - only flag truly critical issues. If you're wrong,
            it could mean serious consequences for the project.

            Use conservative language and minimize superlatives. Assume the reader has
            a heart condition - just articulate facts without emotion.

            **CRITICAL**: You must respond with EXACTLY one of these formats:
            1. 'BUG_DETECTED: [description, line numbers and suggested fix]'
            2. 'NO_BUG_DETECTED' if issues are not critical enough

            For each issue found, provide:
            1. The specific file and line(s) where the issue occurs
            2. A clear description of what is wrong
            3. A suggested fix

            **OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**: End your response with a single line containing only:
            - `STAGE3_RESULT - POTENTIAL_BUG_CONFIRMED` or
            - `STAGE3_RESULT - NO_BUG_FOUND`

            ## Three-Stage Analysis Summary

            Generate a final summary report based on the completed analysis stages:

            **Stage 1 Result**: ${{ steps.stage1_result.outputs.result || 'Not completed' }}
            **Stage 2 Result**: ${{ steps.stage2_result.outputs.result || 'Skipped - Stage 1 found no bugs' }}
            **Stage 3 Result**: ${{ steps.stage3_result.outputs.result || 'Skipped - Stage 2 did not confirm bugs' }}

            **Analysis Process**:
            - Stage 1 (Initial Screening): ${{ steps.stage1.conclusion }}
            - Stage 2 (Database Expert): ${{ steps.stage2.conclusion || 'Skipped' }}
            - Stage 3 (Principal Engineer): ${{ steps.stage3.conclusion || 'Skipped' }}

            Provide a clear, concise summary of:
            1. How many stages were executed
            2. The final determination (critical bug found or no critical bugs)
            3. If bugs were found, what actions are recommended

            ## Actions

            ### If Stage 3 confirmed bugs (STAGE3_RESULT - POTENTIAL_BUG_CONFIRMED):

            1. For each specific bug identified in the Stage 3 results, use
               mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment to post a concise inline
               comment on the exact file and line where the issue occurs. Each comment should
               state the issue and suggest a fix in 2-3 sentences.

            2. Post a summary PR comment using:
               gh pr comment $PR_NUM --body "<body>"

               The summary body should contain:
               - A heading: "## AI Review: Potential Issue(s) Detected"
               - A note that inline comments have been added to the relevant lines
               - A link: [View full analysis]($RUN_URL)
               - Feedback instructions:
                 "If helpful: add `O-AI-Review-Real-Issue-Found` label.
                  If not helpful: add `O-AI-Review-Not-Helpful` label."

            3. Add a label to the PR:
               gh pr edit $PR_NUM --add-label "o-AI-Review-Potential-Issue-Detected"

            ### If no bugs were confirmed:

            Provide a brief textual summary only. Do NOT post any PR comments or labels.
