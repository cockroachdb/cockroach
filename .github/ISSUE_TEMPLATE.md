**FEATURE REQUEST**

1. Does an issue already exist addressing this request? If yes, please add a :+1: reaction to the existing issue. If not, move on to step 2.

2. Please describe the feature you are requesting, as well as your proposed use case for this feature.

3. Indicate the importance of this issue to you (blocker, must-have, should-have, nice-to-have). Are you currently using any workarounds to address this issue?

**BUG REPORT**

1. Please supply the header (i.e. the first few lines) of your most recent
   log file **for each node in your cluster**. On most unix-based systems
   running with defaults, this boils down to the output of

     grep -F '[config]' cockroach-data/logs/cockroach.log

   When log files are not available, supply the output of `cockroach version`
   and all flags/environment variables passed to `cockroach start` instead.

2. Please describe the issue you observed:

- What did you do?

- What did you expect to see?

- What did you see instead?
