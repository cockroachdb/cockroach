// InternalTimeSeriesData is a collection of data samples for some
// measurable value, where each sample is taken over a uniform time
// interval.
//
// The collection itself contains a start timestamp (in seconds since the unix
// epoch) and a sample duration (in milliseconds). Each sample in the collection
// will contain a positive integer offset that indicates the length of time
// between the start_timestamp of the collection and the time when the sample
// began, expressed as an whole number of sample intervals. For example, if the
// sample duration is 60000 (indicating 1 minute), then a contained sample with
// an offset value of 5 begins (5*60000ms = 300000ms = 5 minutes) after the
// start timestamp of this data.
//
// This is meant to be an efficient internal representation of time series data,
// ensuring that very little redundant data is stored on disk. With this goal in
// mind, this message does not identify the variable which is actually being
// measured; that information is expected be encoded in the key where this
// message is stored.
