$cchar\\
$cchar Things to keep in mind for release notes:\\
$cchar   - past tense (this was changed...) or present tense (now possible to...)\\
$cchar   - what has changed: narrow down the product area / feature\\
$cchar     Note: for bug fixes, indicate since when the bug was present\\
$cchar   - show what changed: how a user can see the change for themselves\\
$cchar     Note: for bug fixes, show the symptom(s) to recognize the bug\\
$cchar   - why the change: who does this impact, how and why should they care\\
$cchar\\

$cchar Example release notes:\\
$cchar\\
$cchar   Release note (sql change): The IMPLEMENT statement was extended\\
$cchar   to support the new STEP clause. This can be used to\\
$cchar   implement more gradually, as often required by teams of two\\
$cchar   or more.\\
$cchar\\
$cchar   Release note (bug fix): The system.replication_stats report no longer\\
$cchar   erroneously considers some ranges belonging to table partitions to be\\
$cchar   over-replicated. This bug was present since version 19.2.\\
$cchar\\
$cchar Categories for release notes:\\
$cchar   - cli change\\
$cchar   - ops change\\
$cchar   - sql change\\
$cchar   - api change\\
$cchar   - ui change\\
$cchar   - security update\\
$cchar   - general change (e.g., change of required Go version)\\
$cchar   - build change (e.g., compatibility with older CPUs)\\
$cchar   - enterprise change (e.g., change to backup/restore)\\
$cchar   - backwards-incompatible change\\
$cchar   - performance improvement\\
