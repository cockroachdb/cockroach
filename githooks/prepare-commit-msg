sed_script+="$cchar An issue or epic reference must be in the PR body or each commit message\\

$cchar Things to keep in mind for release notes:\\
$cchar   - past tense (this was changed...) or present tense (now possible to...)\\
$cchar   - what has changed: narrow down the product area / feature\\
$cchar     Note: for bug fixes, indicate since when the bug was present\\
$cchar   - show what changed: how a user can see the change for themselves\\
$cchar     Note: for bug fixes, show the symptom(s) to recognize the bug\\
$cchar   - why the change: who does this impact, how and why should they care\\

$cchar Example release notes:\\
$cchar\\
$cchar   Release note (sql change): The IMPLEMENT statement was extended\\
$cchar   to support the new STEP clause. This can be used to\\
$cchar   implement more gradually, as often required by teams of two\\
$cchar   or more.\\
$cchar\\
$cchar   Release note (bug fix): The system.replication_stats report no longer\\
$cchar   erroneously considers some ranges belonging to table partitions to be\\
$cchar   over-replicated. This bug was present since version 19.2.\\
