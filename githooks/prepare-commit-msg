# Commit message recommendations:

#     ---
#     <pkg>: <short description>
#
#     <long description>
#
#     Release note (category): <release note description>
#     ---
#
# Wrap long lines! 72 columns is best.
#
# The release note must be present if your commit has
# user-facing changes. Leave the default above if not.
#
# Categories for release notes:
# - cli change
# - sql change
# - admin ui change
# - general change (e.g., change of required Go version)
# - build change (e.g., compatibility with older CPUs)
# - enterprise change (e.g., change to backup/restore)
# - backwards-incompatible change
# - performance improvement
# - bug fix
