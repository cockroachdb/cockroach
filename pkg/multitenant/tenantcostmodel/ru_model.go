// RU stands for "Request Unit(s)"; the tenant cost model maps tenant activity
// into this abstract unit.
//
// To get an idea of the magnitude of an RU, the cost model was designed so that
// a small point read of < 64 bytes costs 1 RU.
type RU float64

// NetworkCost records how expensive network traffic is between two regions.
// bytes_transmitted * NetworkCost is the RU cost of the network traffic.
type NetworkCost float64

// RequestUnitModel contains the cost model parameters for computing request
// units (RUs). The values are controlled by cluster settings.
//
// The aim of the model is to provide a reasonable estimate of the resource
// utilization of a tenant, excluding storage. A tenant uses resources on the
// SQL pods as well as on the KV cluster; we model the latter based on the KV
// operations performed by the tenant.
//
// The cost model takes into account the following activities:
//
//   - KV "read" and "write" batches. KV batches that read or write data have a
//     base cost, a per-request cost, and a per-byte cost. Specifically, the
//     cost of a read batch is:
//     RUs = KVReadBatch +
//     <count of reads in batch> * KVReadRequest +
//     <size of reads in bytes> * KVReadByte
//     The cost of a write batch is:
//     RUs = KVWriteBatch +
//     <count of writes in batch> * KVWriteRequest +
//     <size of writes in bytes> * KVWriteByte
//
//   - CPU usage on the tenant's SQL pods.
//
//   - Writes to external storage services such as S3.
//
//   - Count of bytes returned from SQL to the client (network egress).
