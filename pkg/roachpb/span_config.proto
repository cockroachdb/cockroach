  // As of v23.2, if both VoterConstraints and Constraints are specified, we

  // VoterConstraints), then:
  //
  // - Any replica chosen to be a voter will satisfy some
  //   ConstraintsConjunction in Constraints.

  // - If no ConstraintsConjunction in VoterConstraints is over-satisfied
  //   (exceeds the implicit or explicit NumReplicas), then voters by
  //   themselves will not over-satisfy any ConstraintsConjunction in
  //   Constraints.
  //
  // For existing clusters, these strictness requirements may not be met, so
  // internally the system tries to do a normalization to meet the strictness
  // requirement.
  //

  // num-replicas=9 num-voters=9
  // constraints:
  //   +region=a:1
  //   +region=b:1
  //   +region=c:1
  //   +region=d:1
  //   +region=e:1
  // voter-constraints:
  //   +region=f:2
  //
  // This is because 7 replicas are unconstrained according to
  // VoterConstraints, and 4 replicas are unconstrained according to
  // Constraints. So (the difference) 3 replicas can satisfy VoterConstraints
  // without any restriction and can over-satisfy some constraint in
  // Constraints.
  //
  // The stricter version of this config has the following VoterConstraints:
  //   +region=a:1
