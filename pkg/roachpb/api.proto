  // order in the batch.
  //
  // This behavior makes it difficult to make assumptions about the resume spans
  // of individual responses in batches that contain either overlapping requests
  // or unordered requests. As such, clients should not make assumptions about
  // resume spans and should instead inspect the result for every request in the
  // batch if if cannot guarantee that the batch is ordered with no overlapping
