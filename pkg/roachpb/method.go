	// containing the pushee's transaction record in order to consult the
	// most up to date txn state. If the conflict resolution can be
	// resolved in favor of the pusher, returns success; otherwise returns
	// an error code either indicating the pusher must retry or abort and
	// restart the transaction.
	PushTxn
	// RecoverTxn attempts to recover an abandoned STAGING transaction. It
	// specifies whether all of the abandoned transaction's in-flight writes
