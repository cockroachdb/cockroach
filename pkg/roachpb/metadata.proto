  // generation is incremented on every split, merge, and every replica change,

  // counter was first introduced to allow the range descriptor resulting from
  // a split and then merge to be distinguishable from the initial range
  // descriptor. This is important since changes to the range descriptors use
  // CPuts to ensure mutual exclusion.
  //
  // See #28071 for details on the above.
  //
  // Generations are also useful to make local replicaGC decisions when applying
  // a snapshot on keyspace that has overlapping replicas (but note that we do
  // not use this at the time of writing due to migration concerns; see below).
  //
  // We want to be able to compare the snapshot range's generation counter to
  // that of the overlapping replicas to draw a conclusion about whether the
  // snapshot can be applied (in which case the overlapping replicas need to be
  // safely removable). To that end, on a split, not only do we increment the
  // left hand side's generation, we also copy the resultant generation to the
  // newly created right hand side. On merges, we update the left hand side's
  // generation so that it exceeds by one the maximum of the left hand side and
  // the right hand side's generations from before the merge.
  //
  // If two replicas (perhaps one of them represented by a raft or preemptive
  // snapshot) as defined by their full range descriptor (including, notably,
  // the generation) overlap, then one of them has to be stale. This is because
  // the keyspace cleanly shards into non-overlapping ranges at all times (i.e.
  // for all consistent snapshots). Since meta ranges (or more generally, range
  // descriptors) are only ever updated transactionally, mutations to the meta
  // ranges can be serialized (i.e. put into some sequential ordering). We know
  // that the descriptors corresponding to both of our replicas can't be from
  // the same consistent snapshot of the meta ranges, so there is a version of
  // the meta ranges that includes only the first replica, and there is a
  // version that includes only the second replica. Without loss of generality,
  // assume that the first version is "older". This means that there is a finite
  // sequence of splits and merges that were applied to the consistent snapshot
  // corresponding to the first version which resulted in the second version of
  // the meta ranges.
  //
  // Each individual operation, thanks to the generational semantics above, has
  // the invariant that the resulting descriptors have a strictly larger
  // generation than any descriptors from the previous version that they cover.
  // For example, if a descriptor [a,c) at generation 5 is split into [a,b) and
  // [b,c), both of those latter range descriptors have generation 6. If [c,d)
  // is at generation 12 and [d, f) is at generation 17, then the resulting
  // merged range [c,f) will have generation 18.
  //
  // At the end of the day, for incoming snapshots, this means that we only have
  // to collect the overlapping replicas and their generations. Any replica with
  // a smaller generation is stale by the above argument and can be replicaGC'ed
  // right away. Any replica with a larger generation indicates that the snapshot
  // is stale and should be discarded. A replica with the same generation is
  // necessarily a replica of the range the snapshot is addressing (this is the
  // usual case, in which a snapshot "overlaps" precisely one replica, which is
  // the replica it's supposed to update, and no splits and merges have taken
  // place at all).
  //
  // For a third note, observe that the generational semantics above may
  // possibly allow range merges without colocation, at least in the sense that
  // the counter examples in #28071 are defused. This is because the
  // generational counter can answer the question whether the overlapping
  // replica is gc'able or not. If it is not gc'able, then by definition the
