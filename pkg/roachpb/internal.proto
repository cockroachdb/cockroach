// InternalTimeSeriesData is a collection of data samples for some
// measurable value, where each sample is taken over a uniform time
// interval.
//
// The collection itself contains a start timestamp (in seconds since the unix
// epoch) and a sample duration (in milliseconds). Each sample in the collection
// will contain a positive integer offset that indicates the length of time
// between the start_timestamp of the collection and the time when the sample
// began, expressed as an whole number of sample intervals. For example, if the
// sample duration is 60000 (indicating 1 minute), then a contained sample with
// an offset value of 5 begins (5*60000ms = 300000ms = 5 minutes) after the
// start timestamp of this data.
//
// This is meant to be an efficient internal representation of time series data,
// ensuring that very little redundant data is stored on disk. With this goal in
// mind, this message does not identify the variable which is actually being
// measured; that information is expected be encoded in the key where this
// message is stored.
//
// The actual samples can be stored in one of two formats: a Row-based format in
// the "samples" repeated field, or a columnar format spread across several
// different repeated columns. The row-based format will eventually be
// deprecated, but is maintained for backwards compatibility. There is no flag
// that indicates whether the data is stored as rows or columns; columnar data
// is indicated by the presence of a non-zero-length "offset" collection, while
// row data is indicated by a non-zero-length "samples" collection. Each data
// message must have all of its data either row format or column format.
//
// One feature of the columnar layout is that it is "sparse", and columns
// without useful information are elided. Specifically, the "offset" and "last"
// columns will always be populated, but the other columns are only populated
// for resolutions which contain detailed "rollup" information about long sample
// periods. In the case of non-rollup data there is only one measurement per
// sample period, and the value of all optional columns can be directly inferred
// from the "last" column. Eliding those columns represents a significant memory
// and on-disk savings for our highest resolution data.
