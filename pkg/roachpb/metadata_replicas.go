// Learners returns the learner replicas in the set.
//
// A learner is a participant in a raft group that accepts messages but doesn't
// vote. This means it doesn't affect raft quorum and thus doesn't affect the
// fragility of the range, even if it's very far behind or many learners are
// down.
//
// At the time of writing, learners are used in CockroachDB as an interim state
// while adding a replica. A learner replica is added to the range via raft
// ConfChange, a raft snapshot (of type LEARNER) is sent to catch it up, and
// then a second ConfChange promotes it to a full replica.
//
// This means that learners are currently always expected to have a short
// lifetime, approximately the time it takes to send a snapshot. Ideas have been
// kicked around to use learners with follower reads, which could be a cheap way
// to allow many geographies to have local reads without affecting write
// latencies. If implemented, these learners would have long lifetimes.
//
// For simplicity, CockroachDB treats learner replicas the same as voter
// replicas as much as possible, but there are a few exceptions:
//
// - Learner replicas are not considered when calculating quorum size, and thus
//   do not affect the computation of which ranges are under-replicated for
//   upreplication/alerting/debug/etc purposes. Ditto for over-replicated.
// - Learner replicas cannot become raft leaders, so we also don't allow them to
//   become leaseholders. As a result, DistSender and the various oracles don't
//   try to send them traffic.
// - The raft snapshot queue does not send snapshots to learners for reasons
//   described below.
// - Merges won't run while a learner replica is present.
//
// Replicas are now added in two ConfChange transactions. The first creates the
// learner and the second promotes it to a voter. If the node that is
// coordinating this dies in the middle, we're left with an orphaned learner.
// For this reason, the replicate queue always first removes any learners it
// sees before doing anything else. We could instead try to finish off the
// learner snapshot and promotion, but this is more complicated and it's not yet
// clear the efficiency win is worth it.
//
// This introduces some rare races between the replicate queue and
// AdminChangeReplicas or if a range's lease is moved to a new owner while the
// old leaseholder is still processing it in the replicate queue. These races
// are handled by retrying if a learner disappears during the
// snapshot/promotion.
//
// If the coordinator otherwise encounters an error while sending the learner
// snapshot or promoting it (which can happen for a number of reasons, including
// the node getting the learner going away), it tries to clean up after itself
// by rolling back the addition of the learner.
//
// There is another race between the learner snapshot being sent and the raft
// snapshot queue happening to check the replica at the same time, also sending
// it a snapshot. This is safe but wasteful, so the raft snapshot queue won't
// try to send snapshots to learners.
//
// Merges are blocked if either side has a learner (to avoid working out the
// edge cases) but it's historically turned out to be a bad idea to get in the
// way of splits, so we allow them even when some of the replicas are learners.
// This orphans a learner on each side of the split (the original coordinator
// will not be able to finish either of them), but the replication queue will
// eventually clean them up.
//
// Learner replicas don't affect quorum but they do affect the system in other
// ways. The most obvious way is that the leader sends them the raft traffic it
// would send to any follower, consuming resources. More surprising is that once
// the learner has received a snapshot, it's considered by the quota pool that
// prevents the raft leader from getting too far ahead of the followers. This is
// because a learner (especially one that already has a snapshot) is expected to
// very soon be a voter, so we treat it like one. However, it means a slow
// learner can slow down regular traffic, which is possibly counterintuitive.
