  // This is ultimately because of correctness concerns around SNAPSHOT

  //
  // Intuitively, one could think that the timestamp at which intents should be
  // written should be the provisional commit timestamp, and while this is

  // txn:
  //
  // - txn1 at orig_timestamp=5 reads key1: (value) 1.

  // and commit, but this is not the expected outcome (the expected outcome is
  // {key1: 6} (since txn2 is not expected to commit)) and we would be

  // intent (just above the committed value) not with the intent to commit it,
  // but to avoid being starved by short-lived transactions on that key which
  // would otherwise not have to go through conflict resolution with txn1.

  // when reading a value in the near future as per the max_timestamp field.
  //
  // Morally speaking, having an entry for a node in this map means that this
  // node has been visited before, and that no more uncertainty restarts are
  // expected for operations served from it. However, this is not entirely
  // accurate. For example, say a txn starts with orig_timestamp=1 (and some
  // large max_timestamp). It then reads key "a" from node A, registering an
  // entry `A -> 5` in the process (`5` happens to be a timestamp taken off
  // that node's clock at the end of the read).
  // Now assume that some other transaction writes and commits a value at key "b"
  // and timestamp 4 (again, served by node A), and our transaction attempts to
  // read that key. Since there is an entry in its observed_timestamps for A,
  // our uncertainty window is `[orig_timestamp, 5) = [1, 5)` but the value at
  // key "b" is in that window, and so we will restart. However, we will restart
  // with a timestamp that is at least high as our entry in the map for node A,
  // so no future operation on node A will be uncertain.
  //
  // Thus, expressed properly, you could say that when a node has been read from
  // successfully before, uncertainty on that node is restricted to values with
  // timestamps in the interval [orig_timestamp, first_visit_timestamp), and
  // that no node will trigger restarts more than once (and in fact, usually
  // the first restart also bumps the txn timestamp enough to clear all other
  // nodes).
  //
  // When this list holds a corresponding entry for the node the current
  // request is executing on, we can run the command with the map's timestamp
  // as the top boundary of our uncertainty interval, limiting (and often
  // avoiding) uncertainty restarts.
  //
  // When a transaction is first initialized on a node, it may use a timestamp
  // from the local hybrid logical clock to initialize the corresponding entry
  // in the map. In particular, if `orig_timestamp` is taken from that node's
