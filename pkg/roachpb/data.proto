  // as observed from their local clock during this transaction. The purpose of
  // this list is to avoid uncertainty related restarts which normally occur
  // when reading a value in the near future as per the max_timestamp field.
  //
  // ### Meaning:
  //
  // Morally speaking, having an entry for a node in this list means that this
  // node has been visited before, and that no more uncertainty restarts are
  // expected for operations served from it. However, this is not entirely
  // accurate. For example, say a txn starts with read_timestamp=1 (and some
  // large max_timestamp). It then reads key "a" from node A, registering an
  // entry `A -> 5` in the process (`5` happens to be a timestamp taken off
  // that node's clock at the start of the read).
  //
  // Now assume that some other transaction writes and commits a value at key "b"
  // and timestamp 4 (again, served by node A), and our transaction attempts to
  // read that key. Since there is an entry in its observed_timestamps for A,
  // our uncertainty window is `[read_timestamp, 5) = [1, 5)` but the value at
  // key "b" is in that window, and so we will restart. However, we will restart
  // with a timestamp that is at least high as our entry in the list for node A,
  // so no future operation on node A will be uncertain.
  //
  // ### Correctness:
  //
  // Thus, expressed properly, we can say that when a node has been read from
  // successfully before by a transaction, uncertainty for values written by a
  // leaseholder on that node is restricted to values with timestamps in the
  // interval [read_timestamp, first_visit_timestamp). An upper bound can be
  // placed on the uncertainty window because we are guaranteed that at the time
  // that the transaction first visited the node, none of the Ranges that it was
  // a leaseholder for had served any writes at higher timestamps than the clock
  // reading we observe. This implies the following property:
  //
  //    Any writes that the transaction may later see written by leaseholders on
  //    this node at higher timestamps than the observed timestamp could not have
  //    taken place causally before this transaction and can be ignored for the
  //    purposes of uncertainty.
  //
  // There are two invariants necessary for this property to hold:
  // 1. a leaseholder's clock must always be equal to or greater than the timestamp
  //    of all writes that it has served. This is trivial to enforce for
  //    non-transactional writes. It is more complicated for transactional writes
  //    which may move their commit timestamp forward over their lifetime before
  //    committing, even after writing intents on remote Ranges. To accommodate
  //    this situation, transactions ensure that at the time of their commit, any
  //    leaseholder for a Range that contains one of its intent has an HLC clock
  //    with an equal or greater timestamp than the transaction's commit timestamp.
  //    TODO(nvanbenschoten): This is violated by txn refreshes. See #36431.
  // 2. a leaseholder's clock must always be equal to or greater than the timestamp
  //    of all writes that previous leaseholders for its Range have served. We
  //    enforce that when a Replica acquires a lease it bumps its node's clock to a
  //    time higher than the previous leaseholder's clock when it stopped serving
  //    writes. This is accomplished cooperatively for lease transfers and through
  //    a statis period before lease expiration for lease acquisitions. It then
  //    follows by induction that, in conjunction with the previous invariant, this
  //    invariant holds for all leaseholders, given that a Range's initial
  //    leaseholder assumes responsibility for an empty range with no writes.
  //
  // ### Usage:
  //
  // The property ensures that when this list holds a corresponding entry for
  // the node who owns the lease that the current request is executing under, we
  // can run the request with the list's timestamp as the upper bound for its
  // uncertainty interval, limiting (and often avoiding) uncertainty restarts.
  // We do this by lowering the request's max_timestamp down to the timestamp in
  // the observed timestamp entry, which is done in Replica.limitTxnMaxTimestamp.
  //
  // However, as stated, the correctness property only holds for values at
  // higher timestamps than the observed timestamp written *by leaseholders on
  // this node*. This is critical, as the property tells us nothing about values
  // written by leaseholders on different nodes, even if a lease for one of
  // those Ranges has since moved to a node that we have an observed timestamp
  // entry for. To accommodate this limitation, Replica.limitTxnMaxTimestamp
  // first forwards the timestamp in the observed timestamp entry by the start
  // timestamp of the lease that the request is executing under before using it
  // to limit the request's uncertainty interval.
  //
  // When a transaction is first initialized on a node, it may use a timestamp
  // from the local hybrid logical clock to initialize the corresponding entry
  // in the list. In particular, if `read_timestamp` is taken from that node's
  // clock, we may add that to the list, which eliminates read uncertainty for
  // reads on that node.
  //
  // The slice of observed timestamps is kept sorted by NodeID. Use
  // Transaction.UpdateObservedTimestamp to maintain the sorted order. The
  // slice should be treated as immutable and all updates should be performed
  // on a copy of the slice.

  // write been performed, it would have overwritten the other value even though
  // that value might not have been read by a previous read in the transaction
  // (i.e. lost update anomaly). The write is still performed, but this flag is
  // set and the txn's write timestamp is bumped, so the client will not be able
  // to commit without performing a refresh.
  //
  // Since 20.1, errors do not carry this flag; only successful BatchResponses

  // On the client, the txnSpanRefresher terminates this flag by refreshing

  // enough to avoid hopeless refreshes, though.
  //
  // Historically, this field was also important for SNAPSHOT transactions which
  // could commit in other situations when the write timestamp is bumped, but
  // not when this flag is set (since lost updates cannot be tolerated even in
