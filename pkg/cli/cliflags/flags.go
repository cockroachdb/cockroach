		Name: "attrs",
		Description: `
An ordered, colon-separated list of node attributes. Attributes are arbitrary

specialized hardware or number of cores (e.g. "gpu", "x16c"). For example:
<PRE>

  --attrs=x16c:gpu`,
	}

	Locality = FlagInfo{
		Name: "locality",
		Description: `
An ordered, comma-separated list of key-value pairs that describe the topography
of the machine. Topography might include country, datacenter or rack
designations. Data is automatically replicated to maximize diversities of each
tier. The order of tiers is used to determine the priority of the diversity, so
the more inclusive localities like country should come before less inclusive
localities like datacenter. The tiers and order must be the same on all nodes.
Including more tiers is better than including fewer. For example:
<PRE>

  --locality=country=us,region=us-west,datacenter=us-west-1b,rack=12
  --locality=country=ca,region=ca-east,datacenter=ca-east-2,rack=4

	Background = FlagInfo{
		Name: "background",
		Description: `
Start the server in the background. This is similar to appending "&"

control is not returned to the shell until the server is ready to
accept requests.`,

	SQLMem = FlagInfo{
		Name: "max-sql-memory",
		Description: `
Maximum memory capacity available to store temporary data for SQL clients,
including prepared queries and intermediate data rows during query execution.
Accepts numbers interpreted as bytes, size suffixes (e.g. 1GB and 1GiB) or a
percentage of physical memory (e.g. .25).
If left unspecified, defaults to 128MiB.

If non-empty, create a SQL audit log in this drectory.
`,

	SQLTempStorage = FlagInfo{
		Name: "max-disk-temp-storage",
		Description: `
Maximum storage capacity available to store temporary disk-based data for SQL
queries that exceed the memory budget (e.g. join, sorts, etc are sometimes able
to spill intermediate results to disk).
Accepts numbers interpreted as bytes, size suffixes (e.g. 32GB and 32GiB) or a
percentage of disk size (e.g. 10%).
If left unspecified, defaults to 32GiB.

The location of the temporary files is within the first store dir (see --store).
If expressed as a percentage, --max-disk-temp-storage is interpreted relative to
the size of the storage device on which the first store is placed. The temp
space usage is never counted towards any store usage (although it does share the
device with the first store) so, when configuring this, make sure that the size
of this temp storage plus the size of the first store don't exceed the capacity
of the storage device.
If the first store is an in-memory one (i.e. type=mem), then this temporary "disk"
data is also kept in-memory. A percentage value is interpreted as a percentage
of the available internal memory. If not specified, the default shifts to 100MiB
when the first store is in-memory.
`,

		Name: "cache",
		Description: `
Total size in bytes for caches, shared evenly if there are multiple

		Description: `
Execute the SQL statement(s) on the command line, then exit. This flag may be
specified multiple times and each value may contain multiple semicolon
separated statements. If an error occurs in any statement, the command exits
with a non-zero status code and further statements are not executed. The
results of each SQL statement are printed on the standard output.`,

	CliDebugMode = FlagInfo{
		Name: "debug-sql-cli",
		Description: `
Simplify the SQL CLI to ease troubleshooting of CockroachDB
issues. This echoes sent SQL, removes the database name and txn status

transaction state. Equivalent to --echo-sql, \unset check_syntax,
\unset smart_prompt, and \set prompt1 %n@%M>.`,

csv, table, records, sql, raw, html. If left unspecified, defaults to
tsv for non-interactive sessions and table for interactive sessions.`,

	ClusterName = FlagInfo{
		Name: "cluster-name",
		Description: `
Sets a name to verify the identity of a remote node or cluster. The
value must match between this node and the remote node(s) specified
via --join.

This can be used as an additional verification when either the node or
cluster, or both, have not yet been initialized and do not yet know
their cluster ID.

To introduce a cluster name into an already-initialized cluster, pair
this flag with --disable-cluster-name-verification.`,
	}

	DisableClusterNameVerification = FlagInfo{
		Name: "disable-cluster-name-verification",
		Description: `
Tell the server to ignore cluster name mismatches. This is meant for
use when opting an existing cluster into starting to use cluster name
verification, or when changing the cluster name.

The cluster should be restarted once with --cluster-name and
--disable-cluster-name-verification combined, and once all nodes have
been updated to know the new cluster name, the cluster can be
restarted again with this flag removed.`,

		Description: `
The addresses for connecting a node to a cluster.

to the addresses of 3-5 of the initial nodes. Then run the cockroach

When starting a singe-node cluster, leave this flag out. This will
cause the node to initialize a new single-node cluster without
needing to run the cockroach init command.

When adding a node to an existing cluster, set this flag to 3-5

--listen-addr=:26257 (listen on all interfaces).
Unless --sql-addr is also specified, this address is also
used to accept SQL client connections.

If the address part is left unspecified, it defaults to
the "all interfaces" address (0.0.0.0 IPv4 / [::] IPv6).
If the port part is left unspecified, it defaults to 26257.

defaults to the address part of --listen-addr.
If specified but the port number is omitted, the port

To actually use separate bindings, it is recommended to specify
both flags and use a different port number via --listen-addr, for

to use the same port number but separate host addresses.

	Store = FlagInfo{
		Name:      "store",
		Shorthand: "s",
		Description: `
The file path to a storage device. This flag must be specified separately for
each storage device, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=/mnt/ssd01 --store=/mnt/ssd02 --store=/mnt/hda1

</PRE>
For each store, the "attrs" and "size" fields can be used to specify device
attributes and a maximum store size (see below). When one or both of these
fields are set, the "path" field label must be used for the path to the storage
device, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,attrs=ssd,size=20GiB

</PRE>
In most cases, node-level attributes are preferable to store-level attributes.
However, the "attrs" field can be used to match capabilities for storage of
individual databases or tables. For example, an OLTP database would probably
want to allocate space for its tables only on solid state devices, whereas
append-only time series might prefer cheaper spinning drives. Typical
attributes include whether the store is flash (ssd), spinny disk (hdd), or
in-memory (mem), as well as speeds and other specs. Attributes can be arbitrary
strings separated by colons, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/hda1,attrs=hdd:7200rpm

</PRE>
The store size in the "size" field is not a guaranteed maximum but is used when
calculating free space for rebalancing purposes. The size can be specified
either in a bytes-based unit or as a percentage of hard drive space,
for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=10000000000     -> 10000000000 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB            -> 20000000000 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GiB           -> 21474836480 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.02TiB         -> 21474836480 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20%             -> 20% of available space
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.2             -> 20% of available space
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=.2              -> 20% of available space

</PRE>
For an in-memory store, the "type" and "size" fields are required, and the
"path" field is forbidden. The "type" field must be set to "mem", and the
"size" field must be set to the true maximum bytes or percentage of available
memory that the store may consume, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=type=mem,size=20GiB
  --store=type=mem,size=90%

</PRE>
Commas are forbidden in all values, since they are used to separate fields.
Also, if you use equal signs in the file path to a store, you must use the
"path" field label.`,

Negative value means denotes amount of space that should be left after filling the disk.
If the Size is left unspecified, it defaults to 1GB.

The size can be given in various ways:

The local file path under which remotely-initiated operations that can specify
node-local I/O paths, such as BACKUP, RESTORE or IMPORT, can access files.
Following symlinks _is_ allowed, meaning that other paths can be added by
symlinking to them from within this path.
