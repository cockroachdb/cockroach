An ordered, colon-separated list of node attributes. Attributes are arbitrary

		Name: "locality",
		Description: `
An ordered, comma-separated list of key-value pairs that describe the topography
of the machine. Topography might include country, datacenter or rack
designations. Data is automatically replicated to maximize diversities of each
tier. The order of tiers is used to determine the priority of the diversity, so
the more inclusive localities like country should come before less inclusive
localities like datacenter. The tiers and order must be the same on all nodes.
Including more tiers is better than including fewer. For example:
<PRE>

  --locality=country=us,region=us-west,datacenter=us-west-1b,rack=12
  --locality=country=ca,region=ca-east,datacenter=ca-east-2,rack=4

		Description: `
Maximum storage capacity available to store temporary disk-based data for SQL
queries that exceed the memory budget (e.g. join, sorts, etc are sometimes able
to spill intermediate results to disk). Accepts numbers interpreted as bytes,
size suffixes (e.g. 32GB and 32GiB) or a percentage of disk size (e.g. 10%). If
left unspecified, defaults to 32GiB.
<PRE>

</PRE>
The location of the temporary files is within the first store dir (see --store).
If expressed as a percentage, --max-disk-temp-storage is interpreted relative to
the size of the storage device on which the first store is placed. The temp
space usage is never counted towards any store usage (although it does share the
device with the first store) so, when configuring this, make sure that the size
of this temp storage plus the size of the first store don't exceed the capacity
of the storage device.
<PRE>

</PRE>
If the first store is an in-memory one (i.e. type=mem), then this temporary
"disk" data is also kept in-memory. A percentage value is interpreted as a
percentage of the available internal memory. If not specified, the default
shifts to 100MiB when the first store is in-memory.

Disable SQL statements that may have undesired side effects. For
example a DELETE or UPDATE without a WHERE clause. By default, this
setting is enabled (true) and such statements are rejected to prevent
accidents. This can also be overridden in a session with SET

The addresses for connecting a node to a cluster.

to the addresses of 3-5 of the initial nodes. Then run the cockroach

When starting a singe-node cluster, leave this flag out. This will
cause the node to initialize a new single-node cluster without
needing to run the cockroach init command.

To actually use separate bindings, it is recommended to specify
both flags and use a different port number via --listen-addr, for

The file path to a storage device. This flag must be specified separately for
each storage device, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=/mnt/ssd01 --store=/mnt/ssd02 --store=/mnt/hda1

</PRE>
For each store, the "attrs" and "size" fields can be used to specify device
attributes and a maximum store size (see below). When one or both of these
fields are set, the "path" field label must be used for the path to the storage
device, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,attrs=ssd,size=20GiB

</PRE>
In most cases, node-level attributes are preferable to store-level attributes.
However, the "attrs" field can be used to match capabilities for storage of
individual databases or tables. For example, an OLTP database would probably
want to allocate space for its tables only on solid state devices, whereas
append-only time series might prefer cheaper spinning drives. Typical
attributes include whether the store is flash (ssd), spinny disk (hdd), or
in-memory (mem), as well as speeds and other specs. Attributes can be arbitrary
strings separated by colons, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/hda1,attrs=hdd:7200rpm

</PRE>
The store size in the "size" field is not a guaranteed maximum but is used when
calculating free space for rebalancing purposes. The size can be specified
either in a bytes-based unit or as a percentage of hard drive space,
for example:
<PRE>

  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=10000000000     -> 10000000000 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GB            -> 20000000000 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20GiB           -> 21474836480 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.02TiB         -> 21474836480 bytes
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=20%             -> 20% of available space
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=0.2             -> 20% of available space
  --store=path=/mnt/ssd01,size=.2              -> 20% of available space

</PRE>
For an in-memory store, the "type" and "size" fields are required, and the
"path" field is forbidden. The "type" field must be set to "mem", and the
"size" field must be set to the true maximum bytes or percentage of available
memory that the store may consume, for example:
<PRE>

  --store=type=mem,size=20GiB
  --store=type=mem,size=90%

</PRE>
Commas are forbidden in all values, since they are used to separate fields.
Also, if you use equal signs in the file path to a store, you must use the
"path" field label.`,

usually useful unless that filesystem is actually backed by something like NFS.
