// Package upgrade captures the facilities needed to define and execute
// upgrades for a crdb cluster. These upgrades can be arbitrarily long
// running, are free to send out arbitrary requests cluster wide, change
// internal DB state, and much more. They're typically reserved for crdb
// internal operations and state. Each upgrade is idempotent in nature, is
// associated with a specific cluster version, and executed when the cluster
// version is made active on every node in the cluster.
//
// Examples of upgrades that apply would be upgrades to move all raft state
// from one storage engine to another, or purging all usage of the replicated
// truncated state in KV.
