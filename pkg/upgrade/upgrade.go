// Package upgrade captures the facilities needed to define and execute
// upgrades for a crdb cluster. These upgrades can be arbitrarily long
// running, are free to send out arbitrary requests cluster wide, change
// internal DB state, and much more. They're typically reserved for crdb
// internal operations and state. Each upgrade is idempotent in nature, is
// associated with a specific cluster version, and executed when the cluster
// version is made active on every node in the cluster.
//
// Examples of upgrades that apply would be upgrades to move all raft state
// from one storage engine to another, or purging all usage of the replicated
// truncated state in KV.

// RestoreBehavior explains what the behavior of a given upgrade migration is
// during restoration of table, database or a cluster backups.
//
// For example, a migration that modifies every descriptor in the catalog e.g.
// to populate a new field, needs to also insert itself into RESTORE, so that
// when raw descriptors from a backup that could predate that migration, and
// thus not have that field populated, are injected into the catalog, they are
// migrated accordingly to uphold the invariant that all descriptors in the
// catalog are migrated. Such a migration would use `RestoreActionImplemented`
// and then a sentence specifying what is done during restore, for example:
// RestoreActionImplemented("new field is populated during allocateDescriptorRequests").
//
// If an upgrade migration only affects state that is not restored, such as the
// system tables that contain instance information and liveness, it can use a
// RestoreActionNotRequired string explaining this fact, e.g.
// RestoreActionNotRequired("liveness table is not restored").
