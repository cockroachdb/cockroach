// FenceVersionFor constructs the appropriate "fence version" for the given
// cluster version. Fence versions allow the upgrades infrastructure to safely
// step through consecutive cluster versions in the presence of Nodes (running
// any binary version) being added to the cluster. See the upgrade manager
// above for intended usage.
//
// Fence versions (and the upgrades infrastructure entirely) were introduced
// in the 21.1 release cycle. In the same release cycle, we introduced the
// invariant that new user-defined versions (users being crdb engineers) must
// always have even-numbered Internal versions, thus reserving the odd numbers
// to slot in fence versions for each cluster version. See top-level
// documentation in pkg/clusterversion for more details.
