// All the ranges that include keys between /Meta1 and/ System/tsd are considered

// of a range is within the system span to determine if we should use the
// SystemClass. This eliminates most of the coupling between how system ranges
// are structured (i.e. #NoSplits and # staticSplits lists) and how they
