// serverTimeout is how long the server will wait for a send to be acknowledged
// before automatically closing the connection. This is enforced at two levels:
// by gRPC itself as the timeout for keepalive pings on idle connections, and
// via the OS TCP stack by gRPC setting TCP_USER_TIMEOUT on the network socket.
//
// NetworkTimeout should be sufficient here for TCP_USER_TIMEOUT, but the
// keepalive pings are processed above the Go runtime and are therefore more
// sensitive to node overload (e.g. scheduling latencies). We therefore set it
// to 2x NetworkTimeout to avoid spurious closed connections.
//
// An aggressive timeout is not particularly beneficial here anyway, because the
// client-side timeout (in our case the CRDB RPC heartbeat) is what mostly
// matters for recovery time following network or node outages -- the server
// side doesn't really care if the connection remains open for a bit longer. The
// exception is an asymmetric partition where inbound packets are dropped but
// outbound packets go through -- in that case, an aggressive connection close
// would allow the client to fail and try a different node before waiting out
// the RPC heartbeat timeout. However, this is a rarer failure mode, and does
// not justify the increased stability risk during node overload.

// These are used both to keep the connection alive, and to detect and close
// failed connections from the server-side. Keepalive pings are only sent and
// checked if there is no other activity on the connection.
//
// We set this to 2x PingInterval, since we expect RPC heartbeats to be sent
// regularly (obviating the need for the keepalive ping), and there's no point
// sending keepalive pings until we've waited long enough for the RPC heartbeat
// to show up.
