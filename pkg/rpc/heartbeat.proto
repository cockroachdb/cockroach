  // Dialback is used to turn asymmetric partitions between KV nodes into
  // symmetric partitions. In addition to all the other criteria for making a
  // connection, this check adds an additional criterion that the node receiving
  // a connection needs to be able to initiate a reverse connection to the
  // sender. If this check is not done, then higher-level assumptions in the
  // code can break. Raft can normally handle asymmetric partitions with
  // CheckQuorom and PreVote enabled, however, Lease transfers and other Batch
  // requests will not always work correctly. Rather than fixing all the places
  // in the code above the network layer, it is easier to handle this scenario
  // by preventing asymmetric partitions from happening. Note that by breaking
  // the reverse connection, the asymmetric partition is converted into a
  // partial partition. Partial partitions are handled better by higher layers
  // in the code.
  //
  // In practice, asymmetric partitions can arise from any of the following
  // scenarios:
  //
  //  * Bad/expired certificate on one side
  //  * Incorrect NAT rules
  //  * Incorrect IP address configuration
  //  * Incorrect network routing
  //  * DNS misconfigurations
  //
  // Dialback is only enabled for connections between KV nodes, not between SQL
  // pods or other KV clients. It is enabled by setting the NeedsDialback flag
  // in the construction of an rpc.Context object. Currently, the only place
  // this flag is set is during Server construction. If the flag is not
  // explicitly set, then the NeedsDialback parameter on the PingRequest is left
  // as NONE which disables any checks.
  //
  // If the flag is set, there are two different types of dialback verification
  // the server can do, blocking or non-blocking. This is controlled by the
  // NeedsDialback parameter PingRequest. Long-lived clients normally send
  // PingRequests to servers every few seconds. When a server receives the
  // PingRequest, it will check the NeedsDialback flag, and respond based on the
  // description below.
  //
  // BLOCKING mode requires the receiving server to verify that it can open a
  // connection to the client before it will allow the connection to proceed. It
  // delays responding to the PingRequest until the verification is complete. If
  // there is already an established reverse connection, it can use the
  // existence of that connection to assume dialback is successful. Otherwise,
  // it creates a throw-away connection which it uses to validate the reverse
  // connection. This connection does not send PingRequests, and is closed as
  // soon as validation is complete. It needs to use a throw-away connection to
  // avoid creating a cycle where each node is waiting for the other to finish a
  // BLOCKING connection, and neither one can.
  //
  // NON_BLOCKING mode allows the receiving server to respond to a PingRequest
  // immediately even if there is no reverse connection. If there is an
  // established reverse connection it returns immediately, similar to blocking
  // mode. However if there is not a connection, it asynchronously attempts to
  // create one. Once the outcome of the reverse connection is established, it
  // will apply that result to future PingResponses. The reverse connection for
  // non-blocking mode is not a throw-away connection since it can send
  // PingRequests on it.
  //
  // There are four possible ways that a client can connect to a server and use
  // the NeedsDialback parameger.
  //
  // - NeedsDialback set to NONE on all requests,
  // - NeedsDialback set to BLOCKING on all requests,
  // - NeedsDialback set to NON_BLOCKING on all requests, and
  // - NeedsDialback set to BLOCKING for the first request and NON_BLOCKING for
  //   subsequent requests.
  //
  // As mentioned, non-KV nodes always use option 1.
  //
  // The drawback of always using BLOCKING mode (option 2) is it can add a delay
  // in the middle of an open connection if there is a temporary network
  // disconnection. This happens for instance if the reverse connection times
  // out or has to be restarted. This adds an unnecessary delay to responding.
  //
  // The drawback of always using NON_BLOCKING mode (option 3)  is it allows
  // communication between the client and the server prior to the server detects
  // that it can’t establish a connection back. In practice, this can take a few
  // seconds and during that time, all the problems of not having Dialback in
  // place can occur.
  //
  // Using BLOCKING for only the first connection and NON_BLOCKING for the
  // remainder (option 4) works around these problems. If a reverse connection
  // can’t be established, then it will never allow any traffic in either
  // direction. If the reverse connection breaks later, it will detect it within
  // a few seconds and stop the traffic. There is a possibility that there will
  // be a few seconds outage during this network break, but that would have
  // happened regardless. This is the mode that KV clients use.

    // then permanent (even if a redial would succeed) until the caller
