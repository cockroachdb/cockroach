// GenerateTLP returns two SQL queries as strings that can be used for Ternary
// Logic Partitioning (TLP). TLP is a method for logically testing DBMSs which
// is based on the logical guarantee that for a given predicate p, all rows must
// satisfy exactly one of the following three predicates: p, NOT p, p IS NULL.
// TLP can find bugs when an unpartitioned query and a query partitioned into
// three sub-queries do not yield the same results.
//
// More information on TLP: https://www.manuelrigger.at/preprints/TLP.pdf.
//
// We currently implement a limited form of TLP that can only verify that the
// number of rows returned by the unpartitioned and the partitioned queries are
// equal.
//
// This TLP implementation is also limited in the types of queries that are
// tested. We currently only test basic SELECT query filters. It is possible to
// use TLP to test aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOINs, which have all
// been implemented in SQLancer. See:
// https://github.com/sqlancer/sqlancer/tree/1.1.0/src/sqlancer/cockroachdb/oracle/tlp.
//
// The first query returned is an unpartitioned query of the form:
//
//   SELECT count(*) FROM table
//
// The second query returned is a partitioned query of the form:
//
//   SELECT count(*) FROM (
//     SELECT * FROM table WHERE (p)
//     UNION ALL
//     SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT (p)
//     UNION ALL
//     SELECT * FROM table WHERE (p) IS NULL
//   )
//
// If the resulting counts of the two queries are not equal, there is a logical
// bug.
