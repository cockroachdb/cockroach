// sqlsmith-go
//
// sqlsmith-go is a random SQL query generator, based off of sqlsmith:
//
//   https://github.com/anse1/sqlsmith
//
// You can think of it as walking a randomly generated AST and materializing
// that AST as it goes, which it then feeds into Cockroach with the hopes of
// finding panics.
//
// However, naively generating such an AST will only find certain kinds of
// panics: they're almost guaranteed not to pass semantic analysis, and so
// any components of the system beyond that will probably not be tested.
// To get around this, sqlsmith tracks scopes and types, very similar to
// how the optbuilder works, to create ASTs which will likely pass
// semantic analysis.
//
// It does this by building the tree top-down. Every level of the tree
// requests input of a certain form. For instance, a SELECT will request
// a list of projections which respect the scope that the SELECT introduces,
// and a function call will request an input value of a particular type,
// subject to the same scope it has. This raises a question: what if we
// are unable to construct an expression meeting the restrictions requested
// by the parent expression? Rather than do some fancy constraint solving
// (which could be an interesting direction for this tool to go in the
// future, but I've found to be difficult when I've tried in the past)
// sqlsmith will simply try randomly to generate an expression, and once
// it fails a certain number of times, it will retreat up the tree and
// retry at a higher level.
