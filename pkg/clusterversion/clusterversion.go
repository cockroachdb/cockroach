// Package clusterversion defines the interfaces to interact with cluster/binary
// versions in order accommodate backward incompatible behaviors. It handles the
// feature gates and so must maintain a fairly lightweight set of dependencies.
// The upgrade sub-package handles advancing a cluster from one version to
// a later one.
//
// Ideally, every code change in a database would be backward compatible, but
// this is not always possible. Some features, fixes, or cleanups need to
// introduce a backward incompatibility and others are dramatically simplified by
// it. This package provides a way to do this safely with (hopefully) minimal
// disruption. It works as follows:
//
//   - Each node in the cluster is running a binary that was released at some
//     version ("binary version"). We allow for rolling upgrades, so two nodes in
//     the cluster may be running different binary versions. All nodes in a given
//     cluster must be within 1 major release of each other (i.e. to upgrade two
//     major releases, the cluster must first be rolled onto X+1 and then to X+2).
//   - Separate from the build versions of the binaries, the cluster itself has a
//     logical "active cluster version", the version all the binaries are
//     currently operating at. This is used for two related things: first as a
//     promise from the user that they'll never downgrade any nodes in the cluster
//     to a binary below some "minimum supported version", and second, to unlock
//     features that are not backwards compatible (which is now safe given that
//     the old binary will never be used).
//   - Each binary can operate within a "range of supported versions". When a
//     cluster is initialized, the binary doing the initialization uses the upper
//     end of its supported range as the initial "active cluster version". Each
//     node that joins this cluster then must be compatible with this cluster
//     version.

// Handle is the interface through which callers access the active cluster

	// ActiveVersion returns the cluster's current active version: the minimum
	// cluster version the caller may assume is in effect.
	//
	// ActiveVersion fatals if the cluster version setting has not been
	// initialized (through `Initialize()`).

	// IsActive returns true if the features of the supplied version key are
	// active at the running version. In other words, if a particular version
	// `v` returns true from this method, it means that you're guaranteed that
	// all of the nodes in the cluster have running binaries that are at least
	// as new as `v`, and that those nodes will never be downgraded to a binary
	// with a version less than `v`.
	//
	// If this returns true then all nodes in the cluster will eventually see
	// this version. However, this is not atomic because version gates (for a
	// given version) are pushed through to each node concurrently. Because of
	// this, nodes should not be gating proper handling of remotely initiated
	// requests that their binary knows how to handle on this state. The
	// following example shows why this is important:
	//
	//  The cluster restarts into the new version and the operator issues a SET
	//  VERSION, but node1 learns of the bump 10 seconds before node2, so during
	//  that window node1 might be receiving "old" requests that it itself
	//  wouldn't issue any more. Similarly, node2 might be receiving "new"
	//  requests that its binary must necessarily be able to handle (because the
	//  SET VERSION was successful) but that it itself wouldn't issue yet.
	//
	// This is still a useful method to have as node1, in the example above, can
	// use this information to know when it's safe to start issuing "new"
	// outbound requests. When receiving these "new" inbound requests, despite
	// not seeing the latest active version, node2 is aware that the sending
	// node has, and it will too, eventually.
	IsActive(context.Context, Key) bool

	// BinaryVersion returns the build version of this binary.
	BinaryVersion() roachpb.Version

	// BinaryMinSupportedVersion returns the earliest binary version that can
	// interoperate with this binary.
	BinaryMinSupportedVersion() roachpb.Version

	// SetActiveVersion lets the caller set the given cluster version as the
	// currently active one. When a new active version is set, all subsequent
	// calls to `ActiveVersion`, `IsActive`, etc. will reflect as much. The
	// ClusterVersion supplied here is one retrieved from other node.
	//
	// This has a very specific intended usage pattern, and is probably only
	// appropriate for usage within the BumpClusterVersion RPC and during server
	// initialization.
	//
	// NB: It's important to note that this method is tightly coupled to cluster
	// version initialization (through `Initialize` above) and the version
	// persisted to disk. Specifically the following invariant must hold true:
	//
	//  If a version vX is active on a given server, upon restart, the version
	//  that is immediately active must be >= vX (in practice it'll almost
	//  always be vX).
	//
	// This is currently achieved by always durably persisting the target
	// cluster version to the store local keys.StoreClusterVersionKey() before
	// setting it to be active. This persisted version is also consulted during
	// node restarts when initializing the cluster version, as seen by this
	// node.
	SetActiveVersion(context.Context, ClusterVersion) error

	// SetOnChange installs a callback that's invoked when the active cluster
	// version changes. The callback should avoid doing long-running or blocking

	// updates.
