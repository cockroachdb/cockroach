// Version constants. These drive compatibility between versions as well as
// upgrades (formerly "migrations"). Before you add a version or consider
// removing one, please familiarize yourself with the rules below.
//
// # Adding Versions
//
// You'll want to add a new one in the following cases:
//
//	(a) When introducing a backwards incompatible feature. Broadly, by this we
//	mean code that's structured as follows:
//
//		if (specific-version is active) {
//			// Implies that all nodes in the cluster are running binaries that
//			// have this code. We can "enable" the new feature knowing that
//			// outbound RPCs, requests, etc. will be handled by nodes that know
//			// how to do so.
//		} else {
//			// There may be some nodes running older binaries without this code.
//			// To be safe, we'll want to behave as we did before introducing
//			// this feature.
//		}
//
//	Authors of upgrades need to be careful in ensuring that end-users
//	aren't able to enable feature gates before they're active. This is fine:
//
//		func handleSomeNewStatement() error {
//			if !(specific-version is active) {
//				return errors.New("cluster version needs to be bumped")
//	 		}
//			// ...
//		}
//
//	At the same time, with requests/RPCs originating at other crdb nodes, the
//	initiator of the request gets to decide what's supported. A node should
//	not refuse functionality on the grounds that its view of the version gate
//	is as yet inactive. Consider the sender:
//
//		func invokeSomeRPC(req) {
//			if (specific-version is active) {
//				// Like mentioned above, this implies that all nodes in the
//				// cluster are running binaries that can handle this new
//				// feature. We may have learned about this fact before the
//				// node on the other end. This is due to the fact that migration
//				// manager informs each node about the specific-version being
//				// activated active concurrently. See BumpClusterVersion for
//				// where that happens. Still, it's safe for us to enable the new
//				// feature flags as we trust the recipient to know how to deal
//				// with it.
//				req.NewFeatureFlag = true
//			}
//			send(req)
//		}
//
//	And consider the recipient:
//
//		func someRPC(req) {
//			if !req.NewFeatureFlag {
//				// Legacy behavior...
//			}
//			// There's no need to even check if the specific-version is active.
//			// If the flag is enabled, the specific-version must have been
//			// activated, even if we haven't yet heard about it (we will pretty
//			// soon).
//		}
//
//	See clusterversion.Handle.IsActive and usage of some existing versions
//	below for more clues on the matter.
//
//	(b) When cutting a major release branch. When cutting release-20.2 for
//	example, you'll want to introduce the following to `master`.
//
//	   (i)  V20_2 (keyed to v20.2.0-0})
//	   (ii) V21_1Start (keyed to v20.2.0-1})
//
//	You'll then want to backport (i) to the release branch itself (i.e.
//	release-20.2). You'll also want to bump MinSupported. In the
//	example above, you'll set it to V20_2. This indicates that the
//	minimum cluster version required in a cluster with nodes running
//	v21.1 binaries (including pre-release alphas) is v20.2, i.e. that an
//	upgrade to v21.1 must start out from at least v20.2 nodes.
//
//	Aside: At the time of writing, the min supported version is the
//	last major release, though we may consider relaxing this in the future
//	(i.e. for example could skip up to one major release) as we move to a more
//	frequent release schedule.
//
// When introducing a version constant, you'll want to:
//
//	(1) Prefix its name with the version in which it will be released.
//	(2) Add it at the end of this block. For versions introduced during and
//	    after the 21.1 release, Internal versions must be even-numbered. The
//	    odd versions are used for internal book-keeping. The Internal version
//	    should be the previous Internal version for the same minor release plus
//	    two.
//	(3) Add it at the end of the `versionsSingleton` block below.
//
// # Upgrades
//
// Upgrades are idempotent functions that can be attached to versions and will
// be rolled out before the respective cluster version gets rolled out. They are
// primarily a means to remove legacy state from the cluster. For example, an
// upgrade might scan the cluster for an outdated type of table descriptor and
// rewrite it into a new format. Upgrade are tricky to get right and have their
// own documentation in ./pkg/upgrade, which you should peruse should you feel
// that an upgrade is necessary for your use case.
//
// ## Bootstrap upgrades
//
// Bootstrap upgrades are two upgrades that run as initialization steps when
// bootstrapping a new cluster, regardless of the version (baked-in migrations)
// at which the cluster bootstrapped. When all clusters -- both those being
// freshly created and those being upgraded from some older version -- need to
// run some piece of code, typically that code is called both in an upgrade
// migration that existing clusters will run during upgrade and in the bootstrap
// upgrades that only new clusters will run; bootstrap upgrades are not re-run
// during later upgrades, so any modifications to them also need to be run as
// separate upgrades.
//
// # Phasing out Versions and Upgrades
//
// Versions can be removed once they are no longer
// going to be exercised. This is primarily driven by the
// MinSupported version, which declares the oldest *cluster* (not binary)
// version of CockroachDB that may interface with the running node. It typically
// trails the current version by one release. For example, if the current branch
// is a `21.1.x` release, you will have MinSupported=`21.0`,
// meaning that the versions 20.2.0-1, 20.2.0-2, etc are always going to be
// active on any peer and thus can be "baked in"; similarly all upgrades
// attached to any of these versions can be assumed to have run (or not having
// been necessary due to the cluster having been initialized at a higher version
// in the first place). Note that this implies that all peers will have a
// *binary* version of at least the MinSupported version as well, as this is a
// prerequisite for running at that cluster version. Finally, note that even
// when all cluster versions known to the current binary are active (i.e. most
// of the time), you still need to be able to inter-op with older *binary*
// and/or *cluster* versions. This is because *tenants* are allowed to run at
// any binary version compatible with (i.e. greater than or equal to) the
// MinSupported version. To give a concrete example, a fully up-to-date v21.1 KV
// host cluster can have tenants running against it that use the v21.0 binary
// and any cluster version known to that binary (v20.2-0 ... v20.2-50 or
// thereabouts).
//
// You'll want to delete versions from this list after cutting a major release.
// Once the development for 21.1 begins, after step (ii) from above, all
// versions introduced in the previous release can be removed (everything prior
// to V20_2 in our example).
//
// When removing a version, you'll want to remove its associated runtime checks.
// All "is active" checks for the key will always evaluate to true. You'll also
// want to delete the constant and remove its entry in the `versionsSingleton`
// block below.
