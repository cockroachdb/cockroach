  tp_delta collects prev2 as last 2 [kv2 throughput]
  tp_delta computes tp_up_ramp as first(prev2) == 0 && last(prev2) > 0

  restart_lat_spike audits only while mood == 'yellow' || mood == 'clear'
  restart_lat_spike expects always: tp_up_ramp || [kv2 lat99] <= (3 * lat99_ref)
  restart_lat_spike only helps
