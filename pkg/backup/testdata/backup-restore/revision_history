# Regression test for #62738.
# The latest version of this descriptor will have indexes 1 and 3 visible.
# Since there is no data in index 2 and it is dropped it will merge these
# indexes to backup the span /Table/55/{1-4}. The earlier revision of the
# descriptor will add the span for index 2 /Table/55/{2-3}. These spans should
# be allowed to overlap.
