      <Anchor href={hashJoin}>Hash join</Anchor> is used when merge join cannot

  lookupJoin: (
    <span>
      <Anchor href={lookupJoin}>Lookup join</Anchor> is used where there is a
      large imbalance in size between the tables. The larger table must be
      indexed on the equality column. Each row in the small table is read where
      the rows are &apos;looked up&apos; in the larger table for matches.

      The scan (or reverse scan) operator indicates which and how the table(s)
      in the statement&apos;s FROM clause and its index is read.

  sort: (
    <span>
      The sort operator indicates the statement contains an ORDER BY clause.
