## Temporary Shared Component Library
This folder contains base components lifted from the cloud UI repository, which will eventually
be published as a package. Until then, we're copying components over to this directory to minimize
repeated UI work.

The files in this directory should not be edited. In the circumstance where a component must be
modified slightly we should make note of it to make the corresponding change in the published
package once it exists.

### List of modified components requiring upstream changes:
- `search.tsx` - removed "Search" label - we should make label a prop.
