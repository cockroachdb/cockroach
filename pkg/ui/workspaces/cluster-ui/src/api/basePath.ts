// Examples:
//  joinPathsEnsureRelative("",  "/_status") -> Error! Not a relative path.
//  joinPathsEnsureRelative("/", "/_status") -> Error! Not a relative path.
//  joinPathsEnsureRelative("",  "_status") -> "_status"
//  joinPathsEnsureRelative("/", "_status") -> "/_status"
//  joinPathsEnsureRelative("dbconsole", "_status") -> "dbconsole/_status"
