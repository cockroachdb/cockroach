USAGE: $0 COMMAND [ARGS...]

Starts a CockroachDB node with an empty 'movr' database, executing COMMAND with
ARGS when the database serves HTTP traffic on port 8080.

When COMMAND exits, the database is stopped.

EXAMPLES:
    $0 'curl http://localhost:8080'
        Load index.html once the database has started.

    $0 'pnpm run cy:run'
        Run Cypress tests once the database has started.
