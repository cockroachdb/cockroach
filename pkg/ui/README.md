# DB Console

This directory contains the client-side code for CockroachDB's web-based DB
Console, which provides details about a cluster's performance and health. See the
[DB Console docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/ui-overview.html)
for an expanded overview.

## Getting Started

To start developing the UI, be sure you're able to build and run a CockroachDB
node. Instructions for this are located in the top-level README. Every Cockroach
node serves the UI, by default on port 8080, but you can customize the port with
the `--http-port` flag. If you've started a node with the default options,
you'll be able to access the UI at <http://localhost:8080>. If you've started
a node using `demo`, the default port is 8081 and you'll be able to access the UI
at <http://localhost:8081>.

Immdiately upon cloning this repo, your editor may report errors from
[eslint](https://eslint.org/) claiming that `@cockroachlabs/eslint-plugin-crdb`
failed to load. Solve this issue by running the linter once to build the
CRDB-specific plugin, which lives in this repo:
```shell
$ make ui-lint
```

or by building the plugin manually:
```shell
$ pushd pkg/ui/workspaces/eslint-plugin-crdb; yarn && yarn build; popd
```

Behind the scenes, our UI is compiled using a collection of tools that depends on
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and are managed with
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), a package manager that offers more deterministic
package installation than NPM. LTS versions of NodeJS and Yarn v1.x.x are known
to work. [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), Google's internet browser.
Unit tests are run using Chrome's "Headless" mode.

## Developing

When making changes to the UI, it is desirable to see those changes with data
from an existing cluster without rebuilding and relaunching the cluster for each
change. This is useful for rapidly visualizing local development changes against
a consistent and realistic dataset.

We've created a simple NodeJS proxy to accomplish this. This server serves all
requests for web resources (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) out of the code in this
directory, while proxying all API requests to the specified CockroachDB node.

To use this proxy, in Cockroach's root directory run:
```shell
$ ./dev ui watch --db=<target-cluster-http-uri>
```

then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the UI.

To proxy to a cluster started up in secure mode, in Cockroach's root directory run:
```shell
$ ./dev ui watch --db=<target-cluster-http-uri> --secure
```

While the proxy is running, any changes you make in the `src` directory will
trigger an automatic recompilation of the UI. This recompilation should be much
faster than a cold compile—usually less than one second—as Webpack can reuse
in-memory compilation artifacts from the last compile.

Note that calling `./dev` above will hold the bazel lock, but only for the duration of the
initial build. The watcher itself releases the bazel lock, so it's perfectly reasonable to
run `./dev ui watch` in one shell and `./dev build` in another.


### Working with the `cluster-ui` dependency

Many page-level components have been extracted into a
separate repository for sharing with other applications.
You can read all about this division in the [README for the
package](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/pkg/ui/workspaces/cluster-ui/README.md)
which describes a dev workflow that fits well with this package.

### Clearing the local cache
If the vendor directory becomes corrupted, clear it by running in the root Cockroach directory:
```shell
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If the UI cache becomes corrupted, clear it with:
```shell
$ ./dev ui clean --all
$ make ui-maintainer-clean  # Deprecation soon.
```

If all else fails, run
```shell
bazel clean --expunge
```
though be warned your next build will take a while.

## CCL Build

In CCL builds, code in `pkg/ui/ccl/src` overrides code in `pkg/ui/src` at build
time, via a Webpack import resolution rule. E.g. if a file imports
`src/views/shared/components/licenseType`, it'll resolve to
`pkg/ui/src/views/shared/components/licenseType` in an OSS build, and
`pkg/ui/ccl/src/views/shared/components/licenseType` in a CCL build.

CCL code can import OSS code by prefixing paths with `oss/`, e.g.
`import "oss/src/myComponent"`. By convention, this is only done by a CCL file
importing the OSS version of itself, e.g. to render the OSS version of itself
when the trial period has expired.

## Running tests

To run the tests outside of CI:

```shell
$ ./dev ui test
```

## Managing dependencies

The NPM registry (and the Yarn proxy in front of it, registry.yarnpkg.com)
have historically proven quite flaky. Errors during `yarn install` were the
leading cause of spurious CI failures in the first half of 2018. We used yarn's
[offline mirror](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2016/11/24/ offline-mirror/)
functionality through December 2022 (and for the initial 22.2 release), but
Bazel support for that feature was poor to non-existent and the workflow
involved was complicated. Worse, upgrades to Bazel and the deprecation of
rules_nodejs (in favor of rules_js) meant a yarn- vendor submodule prevented
necessary maintenance.

As-of January 2023, NPM dependencies are mirrored to a world-readable Google
Cloud Storage bucket maintained by Cockroach Labs, similar to the Go
dependencies (see [build/README.md](../../build/README.md#dependencies)). This
allows for nearly standard yarn package management workflows, with only two
caveats:

1. Due to rules_nodejs's lack of support for yarn workspaces in Bazel builds,
   each tree under pkg/ui/workspaces/ has its own package.json, its own
   yarn.lock, and its own node_modules/ directory. There is no hoisting of
   shared dependencies into pkg/ui/node_modules, so **dependencies are managed
   independently in each sub-project.**
2. The public registries can be used for initial installation, but have to
   be rewritten before a PR can merge. The linter will help with this, no
   need to worry.

### Adding, Removing, or Updating a dependency
Since there's no shared dependency hoisting and dependencies are managed
independently for each tree under pkg/ui/workspaces (see above), adding,
removing, and updating dependencies must happt happen from the root of the sub-
project, not the general pkg/ui/ root.

Besides that wrinkle, the standard workflows apply:

```sh
# Add left-pad
yarn add left-pad

# Or upgrade to a specific version
yarn add left-pad@1.3.0
# or
yarn upgrade left-pad

# Then remove it (it's deprecated, after all)
yarn remove left-pad
```

These respectively add, upgrade, or remove dependencies using the default
registry for yarn (registry.yarnpkg.com). Before merging, new dependencies must
be mirrored to GCS and lockfiles must be rewritten.

Note that `yarn install` will by default never update a `yarn.lock` file,
thanks to a line in `./yarnrc` that makes `--pure-lockfile` the default. To
force-rewrite a lockfile with `yarn install`, use `yarn install --no-default-
rc`.

As always, be sure to commit modifications resulting from dependency changes,
like updates to `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.

### Mirroring and Rewriting yarn.lock
To upload new dependencies to Google Cloud Storage, you'll need to be a
Cockroach Labs employee signed into the `gcloud` CLI. Simply run
`./dev ui mirror-deps` from the root of `cockroach.git`, and any new
dependencies will be uploaded and all yarn.lock files rewritten:

```sh
# Upload new dependencies to GCS and rewrite yarn.lock files
./dev ui mirror-deps
```

### Testing if yarn.lock Updates are Needed
The default UI lint suite includes testing for required yarn.lock updates:

```sh
./dev ui lint
```

To run _only_ the yarn.lock tests, use `bazel` directly:

```sh
bazel test //pkg/cmd/mirror/npm:are_lockfiles_updated
```

Either way, a failed test will produce a diff between the expected yarn.lock
and the actual yarn.lock, with a reminder to run `./dev ui lint`.
