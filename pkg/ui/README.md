# Admin UI

This directory contains the client-side code for CockroachDB's web-based admin
UI, which provides details about a cluster's performance and health. See the
[Admin UI docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/explore-the-admin-ui.html)
for an expanded overview.

## Getting Started

To start developing the UI, be sure you're able to build and run a CockroachDB
node. Instructions for this are located in the top-level README. Every Cockroach
node serves the UI, by default on port 8080, but you can customize the port with
the `--http-port` flag. If you've started a node with the default options,
you'll be able to access the UI at <http://localhost:8080>.

Our UI is compiled using a collection of tools that depends on
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and are managed with
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), a package manager that offers more deterministic
package installation than NPM. NodeJS 6.x and Yarn 1.7.0 are known to work.
[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), Google's internet browser. Unit tests
are run using Chrome's "Headless" mode.

With Node and Yarn installed, bootstrap local development by running `make` in
this directory. This will run `yarn install` to install our Node dependencies,
run the tests, and compile the assets. Asset compilation happens in two steps.
First, [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) runs the TypeScript compiler and CSS
preprocessor to assemble assets into the `dist` directory. Then, we package
those assets into `embedded.go` using
[go-bindata](https://github.com/kevinburke/go-bindata). When you later run `make
build` in the parent directory, `embedded.go` is linked into the `cockroach`
binary so that it can serve the admin UI when you run `cockroach start`.

## Developing

When making changes to the UI, it is desirable to see those changes with data
from an existing cluster without rebuilding and relaunching the cluster for each
change. This is useful for rapidly visualizing local development changes against
a consistent and realistic dataset.

We've created a simple NodeJS proxy to accomplish this. This server serves all
requests for web resources (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) out of the code in this
directory, while proxying all API requests to the specified CockroachDB node.

To use this proxy, in Cockroach's root directory run:
```shell
$ make ui-watch TARGET=<target-cluster-http-uri>
```

or, in `pkg/ui` run:
```shell
$ make watch TARGET=<target-cluster-http-uri>
```

then navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the UI.

To proxy to a cluster started up in secure mode, in Cockroach's root directory run:
```shell
$ make ui-watch-secure TARGET=<target-cluster-https-uri>
```

or, in `pkg/ui` run:
```shell
$ make watch-secure TARGET=<target-cluster-https-uri>
```

then navigate to `https://localhost:3000` to access the UI.

While the proxy is running, any changes you make in the `src` directory will
trigger an automatic recompilation of the UI. This recompilation should be much
faster than a cold compile—usually less than one second—as Webpack can reuse
in-memory compilation artifacts from the last compile.

If you get cryptic TypeScript compile/lint failures upon running `make` that
seem completely unrelated to your changes, try removing `yarn.installed` and
`node_modules` before re-running `make` (do NOT run `yarn install` directly).

Be sure to also commit modifications resulting from dependency changes, like
updates to `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.

### DLLs for speedy builds

To improve Webpack compile times, we split the compile output into three
bundles, each of which can be compiled independently. The feature that enables
this is [Webpack's DLLPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/), named
after the Windows term for shared libraries ("**d**ynamic-**l**ink
**l**ibraries").

Third-party dependencies, which change infrequently, are contained in the
[vendor DLL]. Generated protobuf definitions, which change more frequently, are
contained in the [protos DLL]. First-party JavaScript and TypeScript are
compiled in the [main app bundle], which is then "linked" against the two DLLs.
This means that updating a dependency or protobuf only requires rebuilding the
appropriate DLL and the main app bundle, and updating a UI source file doesn't
require rebuilding the DLLs at all. When DLLs were introduced, the time required
to start the proxy was reduced from over a minute to under five seconds.

DLLs are not without costs. Notably, the development proxy cannot determine when
a DLL is out-of-date, so the proxy must be manually restarted when dependencies
or protobufs change. (The Make build system, however, tracks the DLLs'
dependencies properly, so a top-level `make build` will rebuild exactly the
necessary DLLs.) DLLs also make the Webpack configuration rather complicated.
Still, the tradeoff seems well worth it.

## CCL Build

In CCL builds, code in `pkg/ui/ccl/src` overrides code in `pkg/ui/src` at build
time, via a Webpack import resolution rule. E.g. if a file imports
`src/views/shared/components/licenseType`, it'll resolve to
`pkg/ui/src/views/shared/components/licenseType` in an OSS build, and
`pkg/ui/ccl/src/views/shared/components/licenseType` in a CCL build.

CCL code can import OSS code by prefixing paths with `oss/`, e.g.
`import "oss/src/myComponent"`. By convention, this is only done by a CCL file
importing the OSS version of itself, e.g. to render the OSS version of itself
when the trial period has expired.

## Running tests

To run the tests outside of CI:

```shell
$ make test
```

## Viewing bundle statistics

The regular build also produces a webpage with a report on the bundle size.
Build the app, then take a look with:

```shell
$ make build
$ open pkg/ui/dist/stats.ccl.html
```

Or, to view the OSS bundle:

```shell
$ make buildoss
$ open pkg/ui/dist/stats.oss.html
```

## Bundling fonts

To comply with the SIL Open Font License, we have reproducible builds of our WOFF
font bundles based on the original TTF files sourced from Google Fonts.

To rebuild the font bundles (perhaps to bring in an updated version of a typeface),
simply run `make fonts` in the UI directory (or `make ui-fonts` elsewhere).  This
requires `fontforge` to be available on your system.  Then validate the updated
fonts and commit them.

To add a new typeface, edit the script `scripts/font-gen` to fetch and convert it,
and then add it to `styl/base/typography.styl` to pull it into the bundle.

## Managing dependencies

The NPM registry (and the Yarn proxy in front of it) have historically proven
quite flaky. Errors during `yarn install` were the leading cause of spurious CI
failures in the first half of 2018.

The solution is to check our JavaScript dependencies into version control, like
we do for our Go dependencies. Checking in the entire node_modules folder is a
non-starter: it clocks in at 230MB and 28k files at the time of writing.
Instead, we use a Yarn feature called the [offline mirror]. We ship a [.yarnrc]
file that instructs Yarn to save a tarball of each package we depend on in the
[yarn-vendor] folder. These tarballs are then checked in to version control. To
avoid cluttering the main repository, we've made the yarn-vendor folder a Git
submodule that points at the [cockroachdb/yarn-vendored] repository.

### Adding a dependency

Let's pretend you want to add a dependency on `left-pad`. Just use `yarn add`
like you normally would:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pkg/ui
$ yarn add FOO
```

When Yarn finishes, `git status` will report something like this:

```bash
$ git status
Changes not staged for commit:
	modified:   pkg/ui/package.json
	modified:   pkg/ui/yarn-vendor (untracked content)
	modified:   pkg/ui/yarn.lock
```

The changes to package.json and yarn.lock are the normal additions of the new
dependency information to the manifest files. The changes to yarn-vendor are
unique to the offline mirror mode. Let's look more closely:

```bash
$ git -C yarn-vendor status
Untracked files:
	left-pad-1.3.0.tgz
```

Yarn has left you a tarball of the new dependency. Perfect! If you were adding
a more complicated dependency, you'd likely see some transitive dependencies
appear as well.

The process from here is exactly the same as updating any of our other vendor
submodules. Make a new branch in the submodule, commit the new tarball, and push
it:

```bash
$ cd yarn-vendor
$ git checkout -b YOURNAME/add-left-pad
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'Add left-pad@1.3.0'
$ git push origin add-left-pad
```

Be sure to push to [cockroachdb/yarn-vendored] directly instead of a personal
fork. Otherwise TeamCity won't be able to find the commit.

Then, return to the main repository and commit the changes, including the new
submodule commit. Push that and make a PR:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ git checkout -b add-left-pad
$ git add pkg/ui
$ git commit -m 'ui: use very smart approach to pad numbers with zeros'
$ git push YOUR-REMOTE add-left-pad
```

This time, be sure to push to your personal fork. Topic branches are not
permitted in the main repository.

When your PR has been approved, please be sure to merge your change to
yarn-vendored to master and delete your topic branch:

```bash
$ cd yarn-vendor
$ git checkout master
$ git merge add-left-pad
$ git push origin master
$ git push origin -d add-left-pad
```

This last step is extremely important! Any commit in yarn-vendored that is
referenced by the main repository must remain forever accessible, or it will be
impossible for future `git clone`s to build that version of Cockroach. GitHub
will garbage collect commits that are not accessible from any branch or tag, and
periodically, someone comes along and cleans up old topic branches in
yarn-vendored, potentially removing the only reference to a commit. By merging
your commit on master, you ensure that your commit will not go missing.

### Verifying offline behavior

Our build system is careful to invoke `yarn install --offline`, which instructs
Yarn to exit with an error if it would need to reach out to the network. Running
CI on your PR is thus sufficient to verify that all dependencies have been
vendored correctly.

You can perform the verification locally if you'd like, though:

```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pkg/ui
$ rm -r node_modules yarn.installed
$ yarn cache clean
$ make
```

If `make` succeeds, you've vendored dependencies correctly.

### Removing a dependency

To remove a dependency, just run `yarn remove`.

Note that removing a dependency will not remove its tarball from the yarn-vendor
folder. This is not as bad as it sounds. When Git fetches submodules, it always
performs a full clone, so it would wind up downloading deleted tarballs anyway
when it fetched older commits.

TODO(benesch): Yarn's offline mode has an additional option,
`yarn-offline-mirror-pruning`, that cleans up removed dependencies' tarballs.
Look into using this once [dcodeIO/protobuf.js#716] is resolved. At the moment,
ProtobufJS tries to install some dependencies at runtime by invoking `npm
install` itself (!); we avoid this by running `yarn install` on its behalf, but
this means two separate packages share the same yarn-vendor folder and this
confuses Yarn's pruning logic.

If the size of the yarn-vendored repository becomes problematic, we can look
into offloading the large files into something like [Git LFS]. This is
contingent upon resolving the above TODO.
