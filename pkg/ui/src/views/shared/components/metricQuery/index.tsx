/**
 * MetricQuery Components
 *
 * These react-like components are intended to express metric queries for graphs
 * in a declarative, HTML-like syntax.  For example, a query for a graph that
 * displays the non-negative rate of change of two metrics on a shared axis:
 *
 * <Axis units={AxisUnits.Duration}>
 *  <Metric name="cr.node.sys.cpu.user.ns" title="User CPU Time" nonNegativeRate />
 *  <Metric name="cr.node.sys.cpu.sys.ns" title="Sys CPU Time" nonNegativeRate />
 * </Axis>
 *
 * This information is used to construct a query to the backend for metrics; it
 * is also used by the parent component to render the query response correctly.
 *
 * While these are react components, they are not intended to be rendered
 * directly and will throw an error if rendered. Instead, it is intended that
 * parent components to read the information expressed by these components and
 * combine it with the result of a query to create some renderable output.
