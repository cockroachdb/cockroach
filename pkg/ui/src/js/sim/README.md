# Cluster Visualization/Simulation

The "sim" directory contains experimental javascript code to create a visual map
of a running cluster. Currently, much of this code is a simulation of some
aspects of a cluster, used to drive visualization code as it is developed.

The code in this directory is temporarily exempted from style/linter concerns,
as it is the subject of rapid prototyping by multiple developers.
