/*
 * Some context here will help.  The types generated by Protobuf.js leave a bit
 * to be desired.  We can't use the classes themselves, because any child
 * properties are typed as the interface variant.  And the interface variant
 * isn't really right, because every property is optional, even though, in fact
 * every property is required (at least in our usage).  This means that we can't
 * use the objects easily without excessive null checks.
 *
 * Internally, we've chosen to just hold on to the original protobuf classes
 * everywhere.  It would probably be better software engineering to instead add
 * an Anti-Corruption Layer between our use of protobuf and the core of the
 * front-end code, but that's not what we're doing.
 *
 * So, when we ask for the Locations from the store, we chose to type them as
 * ILocation (which we hide behind the imported type Location, which is,
 * admittedly, probably a bad idea, too).  Unfortunately, since they're actually
 * protobuf-generated classes, they have a bunch of other stuff in addition to
 * the properties we care about.
 *
 * This method turns an ILocation into a plain object, so we can do a regular
 * deepEquals assertion on it, to make the tests somewhat readable.
 * Unfortunately, because TypeScript thinks we're holding on to an ILocation
 * rather than a Location, we can't call toObject on it directly.  Fortunately,
 * there's a fast path in the fromObject code that returns the original object
 * immediately if it is, in fact, an instance of the Location class.
