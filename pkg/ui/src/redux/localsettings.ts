 * The local settings reducer is designed to store local-only UI settings in

 * between sessions.
 *
 * This is appropriate for use by components which have some local state that is
 * not relevant to any other components in the application; for example, the
 * sort setting of a table. If a value is shared by multiple components,
 * it should be given the full redux treatment with unique modification actions.
