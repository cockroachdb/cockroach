// ProtobufJS's CLI attempts to install its own CLI dependencies at runtime by
// exec'ing NPM. This is crazy. It introduces a dependency on NPM and breaks our
// dependency pinning and vendoring. There is an upstream issue about this [1],
// but it hasn't received any attention in nearly a year.
//
// As a workaround, this script figures out what NPM packages the ProtobufJS CLI
// would install, mirroring the logic in [0], and generates a package.json
// encoding those dependencies. The Makefile can then invoke `yarn install` on
// this synthesized package, giving us enough control over the dependency
// installation to pin and vendor the dependencies. The ProtobufJS CLI will not
// try to invoke NPM itself if its required dependencies are already installed.
//
// TODO(benesch): switch away from ProtobufJS and use protoc's support for
// generating JavaScript directly.
