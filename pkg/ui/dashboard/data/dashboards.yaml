# Dashboard Configuration File
# This file defines multiple dashboards and their associated charts.
# Each dashboard contains a name, description, and a list of charts.
# Chart metadata (axis, tooltip, options, metrics) is derived from metrics.yaml.
#
# Optional 'imports' field can be used to customize TypeScript imports for each dashboard.
# Semicolons will be added automatically during generation.
# If not specified, no additional imports will be added.
#
# Example:
#   imports:
#     - 'import { CapacityGraphTooltip } from "src/views/cluster/containers/nodeGraphs/dashboards/graphTooltips"'
#     - 'import { AnotherComponent } from "src/another/path"'
