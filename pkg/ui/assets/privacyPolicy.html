        basic network topology and other metadata. We use Statistics to provide

  <p class="c3">
    <span class="c2">
      We never share or sell email addresses to third parties for their own
      purposes. We may now or in the future contract with other companies to
      provide certain services to us, such as identity verification, email
      distribution, or business management services, and we may need to give
      them access to information, such as your email address, in order for them
      to perform services for us. Unless we tell you differently, these
      companies do not have any rights to use your email address or any other
      information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. In
      addition, we do at times share aggregated and anonymized Statistics with
      our partners, service providers and the broader CockroachDB community so
      that they can understand how and how often people use our Services and
      their own content or services. We will never disclose your Statistics in a
      manner that would allow a third party to identify you individually, or
      your CockroachDB cluster, without your express consent.

  <p class="c3">
    <span class="c2">
      If we or our assets were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter
      bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
      transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such
      transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may
      continue to use your information as set forth in this policy. We do not
      currently have a parent company or any affiliates, but in the future we
      may and may share your information with them, but they will be subject to
      the same obligations set out in this policy. &nbsp;

      We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any

      applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii)
      detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues,
      or (iii) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.

      We store all of our information, including your personal information,
      using industry-standard techniques. Unfortunately, due to the nature of
      the Internet, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and
      other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any
      time. We do not guarantee or warrant that the techniques we employ will
      prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store.
