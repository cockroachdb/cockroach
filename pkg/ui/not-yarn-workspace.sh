=================================== WARNING ====================================
As-of May 2022, the pkg/ui/ tree is no longer a "yarn workspace", due to Bazel's
lack of support for them. When adding, updating, or otherwise modifying JS
dependencies, be sure to `cd` into the correct package within workspaces/.

As a convenience, running `yarn install` from pkg/ui/ still installs the
dependencies for all packages within workspaces/.
