// A backup is responsible for reading KVs in a target key span and writing them
// to an external storage sink. It is the backup's responsibility to ensure that
// the KVs it has to read as of a certain timestamp have not been
// garbage collected when it goes to read them. To achieve this, the backup,
// prior to execution writes a protected timestamp (pts) record on its target
// schema object, and releases this record upon successful completion.
//
// 1) In the case of a full backup, the pts record will protect data from GC,
// starting at the time the as of which we want to back data up.
//
// 2) In the case of an incremental backup, the pts record will protect data
// from GC, starting at the time at which the previous backup in the chain
// backed data up. This allows the incremental to read all revisions between the
// previous backup and itself.
//
// Previously, (2) meant that the gap between two backups in a chain had to be
// less than the GC TTL of the target schema object. If this was not the case,
// then the data the pts record needs to protect may have already been garbage
// collected, causing the incremental backup to fail.
//
// To decouple scheduled backups from GC TTL we make the backup schedules (full
// and incremental) responsible for managing pts records as described below.
// This is in addition to the job managed pts records explained above.
//
// 1. On successful completion of the first full backup, the full backup schedule
//    will write a pts record to protect all target data as of the time the full
//    backup backed up data. This will be done before the job managed pts record
//    is released, thereby guaranteeing that the data will still be live.
//    The full schedule will then store a reference of this record on the dependent
//    incremental schedule.
//
// 2. On successful completion of every incremental backup adding to the backup
//    chain, the incremental schedule will pull up the PTS record stored on it to
//    protect the target data as of the time the incremental backup covered.
//
// 3. On successful completion of subsequent full backups we will do two things:
//
//  a) Release the pts record stored on the incremental schedule corresponding to the
//     now old chain of backups.
//
//  b) Repeat 1)
//
// You should see that this chaining schema, along with the job managed pts
// records means that we are never trying to protect data at a timestamp that
// might have fallen out of the GC window, without a previously written pts
// record protecting it from GC.

// maybeUpdateSchedulePTSRecord is responsible for managing the schedule owned
// protected timestamp record based on the stage we are in in the scheme
// described above.
