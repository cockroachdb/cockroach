// cloudStorageSink writes changefeed output to files in a cloud storage bucket
// (S3/GCS/HTTP) maintaining CDC's ordering guarantees (see below) for each
// row through lexicographical filename ordering.
//
// Changefeeds offer the following two ordering guarantees to external clients:
//
// 1. Rows are emitted with a timestamp. Individual rows are emitted in
// timestamp order. There may be duplicates, but once a row is seen at a given
// timestamp no previously unseen version of that row will be emitted at a less
// (or equal) timestamp. For example, you may see 1 2 1 2, or even 1 2 1, but
// never simply 2 1.
// 2. Periodically, a resolved timestamp is emitted. This is a changefeed-wide
// guarantee that no previously unseen row will later be seen with a timestamp
// less (or equal) to the resolved one. The cloud storage sink is structured as
// a number of distsql processors that each emit some part of the total changefeed.
// These processors only write files containing row data (initially only in ndjson
// format in this cloudStorageSink). This mapping is stable for a given distsql
// flow of a changefeed (meaning any given row is always emitted by the same
// processor), but it's not stable across restarts (pause/unpause). Each of these
// processors report partial progress information to a central coordinator
// (changeFrontier), which is responsible for writing the resolved timestamp files.
//
// In addition to the guarantees required of any changefeed, the cloud storage
// sink adds some quality of life guarantees of its own.
// 3. All rows in a file are from the same table. Further, all rows in a file are
// from the same schema version of that table, and so all have the same schema.
// 4. All files are partitioned into folders by the date part of the filename.
//
// Two methods of the cloudStorageSink on each data emitting processor are
// called. EmitRow is called with each row change and Flush is called before
// sending partial progress information to the coordinator. This happens with no
// concurrency, all EmitRow and Flush calls for a sink are serialized.
// EmitResolvedTimestamp is only called by the `changeFrontier`.
//
// The rows handed to EmitRow by the changefeed are guaranteed to satisfy
// condition (1). Further, as long as the sink has written every EmitRow it's
// gotten before returning from Flush, condition (2) is upheld.
//
// The cloudStorageSink uses lexicographic filename ordering to provide a total
// ordering for the output of this sink. Guarantees (1) and (2) depend on this
// ordering. Specifically, at any given time, the order of the data written by
// the sink is by lexicographic filename and then by order within the file.
//
// Batching these row updates into files is complicated because:
// a) We need to pick a representative timestamp for the file. This is required
// for comparison with resolved timestamp filenames as part of guarantee (2).
// b) For each topic, the row ordering guarantees must be preserved.
// One intuitive way of solving (b) is to ensure that filenames are emitted in
// strictly lexically increasing order (see assertion in `flushFile()`). This
// guarantees correctness as long as the underlying system is correct.
//
// Before the local progress is sent to the coordinator (called the "local frontier" as
// opposed to the resolved timestamp which is exactly a "global frontier" or
// "changefeed-level frontier"), all buffered data which preceded that update is flushed.
// To accomplish (a), we need two invariants. (a1) is that once Flush is called, we can
// never write a file with a timestamp that is less than or equal to the local frontier.
// This is because the local progress update could indeed cause a resolved timestamp file
// to be written with that timestamp. We cannot break this invariant because the client is
// free to ignore any files with a lexically lesser filename. Additionally, because we
// picked the resolved timestamp filename to sort after a data file with the same
// timestamp, a data file can't even be emitted at the same timestamp, it must be emitted
// at a timestamp that is strictly greater than the last globally resolved timestamp. Note
// that the local frontier is a guarantee that the sink will never get an EmitRow with
// that timestamp or lower. (a2) is that whenever Flush is called, all files written by
// the sink must be named using timestamps less than or equal to the one for the local
// frontier at the time Flush is called. This is again because our local progress update
// could cause the global progress to be updated and we need everything written so far to
// lexically compare as less than the new resolved timestamp.
//
// The data files written by this sink are named according to the pattern
// `<timestamp>-<uniquer>-<topic_id>-<schema_id>.<ext>`, each component of which is as
// follows:
//
// `<timestamp>` is the smallest resolved timestamp being tracked by this sink's
// `changeAggregator`, as of the time the last `Flush()` call was made (or `StatementTime`
// if `Flush()` hasn't been called yet). Intuitively, this can be thought of as an
// inclusive lower bound on the timestamps of updates that can be seen in a given file.
//
// `<topic>` corresponds to one SQL table.
//
// `<schema_id>` changes whenever the SQL table schema changes, which allows us
// to guarantee to users that _all entries in a given file have the same
// schema_.
//
// `<uniquer>` is used to keep nodes in a cluster from overwriting each other's data and
// should be ignored by external users. It also keeps a single node from overwriting its
// own data if there are multiple changefeeds, or if a changefeed gets
// canceled/restarted/zombied. Internally, it's generated by
// `<session_id>-<node_id>-<sink_id>-<file_id>` where `<sink_id>` is a unique id for each
// cloudStorageSink in a running process, `<file_id>` is a unique id for each file written
// by a given `<sink_id>` and <session_id> is a unique identifying string for the job
// session running the `changeAggregator` that owns this sink.
//
// `<ext>` implies the format of the file: currently the only option is
// `ndjson`, which means a text file conforming to the "Newline Delimited JSON"
// spec.
//
// This naming convention of data files is carefully chosen in order to preserve
// the external ordering guarantees of CDC. Naming output files in this fashion
// provides monotonicity among files emitted by a given sink for a given table
// name, table schema version pair within a given job session. This ensures that
// all row updates for a given span are read in an order that preserves the CDC
// ordering guarantees, even in the presence of job restarts (see proof below).
// Each record in the data files is a value, keys are not included, so the
// `envelope` option must be set to `value_only`. Within a file, records are not
// guaranteed to be sorted by timestamp. A duplicate of some records might exist
// in a different file or even in the same file.
//
//
// The resolved timestamp files are named `<timestamp>.RESOLVED`. This is
// carefully done so that we can offer the following external guarantee: At any
// given time, if the the files are iterated in lexicographic filename order,
// then encountering any filename containing `RESOLVED` means that everything
// before it is finalized (and thus can be ingested into some other system and
// deleted, included in hive queries, etc). A typical user of cloudStorageSink
// would periodically do exactly this.
//
// Still TODO is writing out data schemas, Avro support, bounding memory usage.
//
// Now what follows is a proof of why the above is correct even in the presence
// of multiple job restarts. We begin by establishing some terminology and by
// formally (re)stating some invariants about the underlying system.
//
// Terminology
// 1. Characters A,B...Z refer to job sessions.
// 2. Ai, for i in Nat, refers to `the filename of the i'th data file
// emitted by session A`. Note that because of the invariants we will state,
// this can also be taken to mean "the filename of lexically the i'th data
// file emitted by session A". This is a notation simply used for convenience.
// 3. Ae > Bf refers to a lexical comparison of Ae and Bf.
// 4. ts(Xi) refers to the <timestamp> part of Xi.
//
// Invariants
// 1. We assume that the ordering guarantee (1) stated at the beginning of this
// comment blob is upheld by the underlying system. More specifically, this proof
// only proves correctness of the cloudStorageSink, not the entire system.
// To re-state, if the rows are read in the order they are emitted by the underlying
// system, it is impossible to see a previously unseen timestamp that is lower
// than some timestamp we've seen before.
// 2. Data files emitted by a single session of a changefeed job are lexically
// ordered exactly as they were emitted. Xi lexically precedes X(i-1), for i in
// Nat, for all job sessions X. The naming convention described above guarantees
// this.
// 3. Data files are named using the successor of the "local frontier" timestamp as of the
// time the last `Flush()` call was made (or StatementTime in case `Flush()` hasn't been
// called yet). Since all EmitRow calls are guaranteed to be for rows that equal or
// succeed this timestamp, ts(Xi) is an inclusive lower bound for the rows contained
// inside Xi.
// 4. When a job restarts, the new job session starts with a catch-up scan
// from the last globally resolved timestamp of the changefeed. This catch-up
// scan replays all rows since this resolved timestamp preserving invariant 1.
//
// Corollary 1: It is impossible to see a previously unseen timestamp that is
// lower than any timestamp seen thus far, in a lexical ordering of files if the
// files satisfy invariant 2 and the underlying system satisfies invariant 1.
//
// Note that correctness does not necessarily imply invariants 1 and 2.
//
// Lemma 1: Given two totally ordered sets of files X and Y that preserve CDC's ordering
// guarantee along with invariants 3 and 4, their union produces a totally ordered set of
// files that preserves this guarantee.
// Proof of lemma: Lets refer to the data filenames emitted by these sessions as X1,X2....
// and similarly for session Y. Additionally, lets refer to the last file ever emitted by
// session X as Xn, for some n in Nat. Now lexically speaking there are 2 cases here: 1.
// Y1 < Xn: For the sake of contradiction, let's assume there is a violation here. Since
// there is a total lexical ordering among files in each set individually, we must have
// read Y(e-1) before Ye, for all e in Nat. Similarly for X. Without loss of generality,
// lets say there are 2 files Ye and Xf such that (1.1) Ye < Xf and Xf contains an unseen
// timestamp that is lower than at least one timestamp seen in Ye. call this timestamp t.
// More explicitly, it must be the case that this timestamp t does not exist in any files
// Y1...Ye. This must mean that timestamp t lies before the starting point of session Y's
// catch-up scan (again from invariant 4). Thus it must be the case that (1.2) ts(Y1) > t.
// Now, due to invariant 3, we know that we won't see any rows in a file Xi with a
// timestamp that is lower than ts(Xi). This must mean that (1.3) ts(Xf) <= t. Statements
// 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 together give us a contradiction. 2. Y1 > Xn. This case means that all
// data files of session Y lexically succeed all the data files of session X. This means
// that all data files are ordered monotonically relative to when they were emitted, this
// gives us invariant 2 (but for 2 sessions). Correctness follows from this and invariant
// 1. Note that Y1 == Xn is not possible because sessions are assigned unique session IDs.
// QED.
//
// Proof of correctness: It is impossible to see a previously unseen timestamp that is
// lower than any timestamp seen thus far, across n job sessions for all n, n in Nat. We
// do this by induction, let k be the number of job sessions a changefeed job goes
// through:
// Case k = 1: Correctness for this case follows from corollary 1.
// Case k = 2: This follows from lemma 1 stated above.
// Case k > 2 (induction case): Assume that the statement of the proof is true for the
// output of a changefeed job with k sessions. We will show that it must also be true for
// the output of a changefeed job with k+1 sessions. Let's refer to the first k jobs as
// P1,P2,..PK, and the k+1st job as Q. Now, since we assumed the statement is true for
// P1,P2...PK, it must produce a totally ordered (lexical ordering) set of files that
// satisfies requirements of lemma 1. So we can consider these k jobs conceptually as one
// job (call it P). Now, we're back to the case where k = 2 with jobs P and Q. Thus, by
// induction we have the required proof.
