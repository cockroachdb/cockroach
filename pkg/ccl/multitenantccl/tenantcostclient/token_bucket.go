// tokenBucket implements a token bucket. It is a more specialized form of
// quotapool.TokenBucket. The main differences are:
//  - it does not currently support a burst limit;
//  - it implements a "low tokens" notification mechanism;
//  - it has special debt handling.
//
// -- Notification mechanism --
//
// Notifications can be configured to fire when the number of available RUs dips
// below a certain value (or when a request blocks). Notifications are delivered
// via a non-blocking send to a given channel.
//
// -- Debt handling --
//
// The token bucket is designed to handle arbitrary removal of tokens to account
// for usage that cannot be throttled (e.g. read/transferred bytes, CPU usage).
// This can bring the token bucket into debt.
//
// The simplest handling of debt is to always pay the debt first, blocking all
// operations that require tokens in the mean time. However, this is undesirable
// because the accounting can happen at arbitrary intervals which can lead to
// the workload periodically experiencing starvation (e.g. CPU usage might be
// accounted for only once per second, which can lead to all requests being
// blocked for the beginning part of each second).
//
// Instead, we aim to pay all outstanding debt D within time T from the time the
// last debt was incurred. We do this by splitting the refill rate into D/T and
// using only what's left for replenishing tokens.
//
// This rate is recalculated every time we incur debt. So in essence, every time
// we incur debt, we put it together with all existing debt and plan to pay it
// within time T (we can think of this as "refinancing" the existing debt).
//
// This behavior is somewhat arbitrary because the rate at which we pay debt
// depends on how frequently we incur additional debt. To see how much it can
// vary, imagine that at time t=0 we incur some debt D(0) and consider the two
// extremes:
//
//   A. We start with debt D(0), and we never recalculate the rate (no
//      "refinancing"). We pay debt at constant rate D(0) / T and all debt is
//      paid at time T.
//
//   B. We start with debt D(0), and we recalculate the rate ("refinance")
//      continuously (or, more intuitively, every nanosecond).  The
//      instantaneous rate is:
//        D'(t) = - D(t) / T
//      The debt formula is:
//        D(t) = D(0) * e^(-t/T)
//      We pay 63% of the debt in time T; 86% in 2T; and 95% in 3T.
//
// The difference between these two extremes is reasonable - we pay between 63%
// and 100% of the debt in time T, depending on the usage pattern.
//
// Design note: ideally we would always simulate B. However, under this model it
// is hard to compute the time until a request can go through (i.e. time until
// we accumulate a certain amount of tokens): it involves calculating the
// intersection of a line with an exponential, which cannot be solved
// algebraically (it requires slower numerical methods).
