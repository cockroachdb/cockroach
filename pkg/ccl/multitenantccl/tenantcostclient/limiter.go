// limiter is used to rate-limit KV and external I/O operations according to a
// local token bucket.
//
// Operations call the Wait() method in order to block until there are
// sufficient tokens in the bucket. Since operation cost is not known until it
// has completed (e.g. because cost should be zero if operation errors), Wait is
// only called with a non-zero cost after completion. However, the KV operations
// also call Wait before starting, with a zero cost. This prevents new
// operations from proceeding if the token bucket has fallen into debt.
//
// Besides RU usage from KV and external I/O calls, the controller tracks CPU
// and egress network usage (i.e. pgwire egress) in the SQL layer. These costs
// are updated every second and removed from the bucket via the RemoveRU method.
//
