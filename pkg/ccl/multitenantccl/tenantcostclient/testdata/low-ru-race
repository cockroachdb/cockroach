# Advance time enough for a "consumption reporting" request to go out, which
# wouldn't request more RUs.

# Fire off a big write. This will trigger a low RU notification, which may
# happen while the token bucket request is still in progress. Verify that even
# in this case, we can still satisfy the request without more time passing.
