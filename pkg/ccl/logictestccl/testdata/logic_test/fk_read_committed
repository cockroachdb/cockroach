# The transactions run by testuser3 and root are the important part. testuser
# and testuser2 only exist to control the timing of the transactions run by
# testuser3 and root.
#
# The transactions run by testuser3 and root conflict with each other. To
# prevent a FK violation they need to either run serially, or one transaction
# needs to fail.
#
# This test demonstrates that we need locking during both the parent FK check
# and the child FK check to prevent a FK violation.
#
# The parent FK check is performed by the Serializable INSERT run by
# root. Without locking during this check, the two transactions are not
# guaranteed to detect the conflict with each other. For example, without this
# locking, the Read Committed DELETE could finish after the INSERT's FK check
# but before its insert. The INSERT could then write a phantom child row and
# have a successful read refresh, and both transactions could commit. Locking
# during the parent FK check avoids this by forcing the transactions to
# coordinate on the parent row.
#
# The child FK check is performed by the Read Committed DELETE run by
# testuser3. Without locking during this check, the Read Committed DELETE could
# perform a stale read for its child FK check, missing a newer child row. For
# example, it could miss the row written by the Serializable INSERT and
# successfully commit. (Serializable isolation does not have this same risk of
# stale reads and thus does not need locking during child FK checks.)
#
# For more discussion of this and other scenarios please see #151663.
