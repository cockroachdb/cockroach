// maybeSetCorrupt is a stand-in for proper handling of failing replicas. Such a
// failure is indicated by a call to maybeSetCorrupt with a ReplicaCorruptionError.
// Currently any error is passed through, but prospectively it should stop the
// range from participating in progress, trigger a rebalance operation and
// decide on an error-by-error basis whether the corruption is limited to the
// range, store, node or cluster with corresponding actions taken.
//
// TODO(d4l3k): when marking a Replica corrupt, must subtract its stats from
// r.store.metrics. Errors which happen between committing a batch and sending
// a stats delta from the store are going to be particularly tricky and the
// best bet is to not have any of those.
// @bdarnell remarks: Corruption errors should be rare so we may want the store
// to just recompute its stats in the background when one occurs.
