	// sender  (leader)    [a--lhs--b)[b---rhs----c)

	//                                 ÊŒ                /

	//                                         'b'
	//
	// However, it's also possible that the left hand side has been rebalanced
	// away and is going to be GC'ed soon; queue a check to make sure this would
	// happen ASAP. (The leader will probe this replica only once per heartbeat
	// interval, so we're not going to queue these checks at some high rate).
	//
	// New replicas only get created through splits or rebalances, so if we
	// don't find a left hand side, it was either garbage collected after having
	// been removed from the store (see the above comment), or there wasn't a
	// split in the first case and this replica was instead created through an
	// up-replication for which the preemptive snapshot had been lost (i.e.
	// accidentally GC'ed before the replication change succeeded).
	//
	// Note that there's a subtle case in which the left hand side is caught up
	// across the split trigger via a snapshot. In that case, since we're looking
	// up the start key of the right-hand side, we have the following picture:
	//
	// sender  (leader)    [a--lhs--b)[b---rhs----c)
	//                                             \
	//                                              \
	//                                            (1)\ MsgApp (startKey='b')
	//                                                \
	//                                                 v
	// recipient           [a--lhs--b)               (this uninitialized replica)
	//
	// Trying to look up the replica for 'b', we'd come up empty and deliver the
	// message, resulting in a snapshot, as intended.
	//
	// Note that the invariant that the start key points at a replica that will
	// definitely apply the split trigger holds even if the left-hand range
	// carries out splits (as that doesn't change its start key) or gets merged
	// away (as this entails either a removal of the follower's replica during
	// colocation, or waiting for the follower to have caught up which implies
	// executing all pending split triggers).
