	// However, it's also possible that the left hand side has been rebalanced
	// away and is going to be GC'ed soon; queue a check to make sure this would
	// happen ASAP. (The leader will probe this replica only once per heartbeat
	// interval, so we're not going to queue these checks at some high rate).
	//
	// New replicas only get created through splits or rebalances, so if we
	// don't find a left hand side, it was either garbage collected after having
	// been removed from the store (see the above comment), or there wasn't a
	// split in the first case and this replica was instead created through an
	// up-replication for which the preemptive snapshot had been lost (i.e.
	// accidentally GC'ed before the replication change succeeded).
	//
	// Note that there's a subtle case in which the left hand side is caught up
	// across the split trigger via a snapshot. In that case, since we're looking
	// up the start key of the right-hand side, we have the following picture:
	//
	// sender  (leader)    [a--lhs--b)[b---rhs----c)
	//                                             \
	//                                              \
	//                                            (1)\ MsgApp (Context='b')
