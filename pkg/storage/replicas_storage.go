// TODO(sumeer):
// Steps:
// - Pick names for C1-C3 and D1-D2, to make it easier to remember what we are
//   referring to in various places.
// - Consider separating RecoveryInconsistentReplica into two different states
//   RecoveryRaftAndStateInconsistent, and RecoveryStateInconsistent.
// - Proof sketch.
// - Read cockroach debug check-store to see additional assertion ideas/code
//   we can lift.
// - Implement interface.
// - Unit tests and randomized tests, including engine restarts that lose
//   state (using vfs.NewStrictMem).
// - Benchmarks comparing single and two engine implementations.
// - Race-build dynamically asserts that SSTs or MutationBatches that are
//   passed through this interface only touch the keys they are allowed to

// High-level overview:
//
// ReplicasStorage provides an interface to manage the persistent state that
// includes the lifecycle of a range replica, its raft log, and the state
// machine state. The implementation(s) are expected to be a stateless wrapper
// around persistent state in the underlying engine(s) (any state they
// maintain in-memory is simply a performance optimization and always
// in-sync with the persistent state). Since this abstraction is mutating the
// same underlying engine state that was previously mutated via lower-level
// interfaces, and is not a data-structure in the usual sense, we can migrate
// callers incrementally to use this interface. That is, callers that use this
// interface, and those that use the lower-level engine interfaces can
// co-exist correctly.
//
// TODO(sumeer): this co-existence is not completely true since the following
// attempts to define an ideal interface where no sst or MutationBatch touches
// both raft engine state or state machine engine state. Which means transient
// inconsistencies can develop. We will either
// - alter this interface to be more pragmatic, i.e., be a step towards the
//   ideal interface, but not the end product, once we have settled on the
//   ideal interface.
// - ensure that the minimal integration step includes ReplicasStorage.Init,
//   which can eliminate any inconsistencies caused by an inopportune crash.
// Hopefully, the latter is sufficient.
//
// We consider the following distinct kinds of persistent state:
// - State machine state: It contains all replicated keys: replicated range-id
//   local keys, range local keys, range lock keys, global keys. NB: this
//   includes the RangeAppliedState and the RangeDescriptor.
//
// - Raft state: This includes all the unreplicated range-ID local key names
//   prefixed by Raft. We will loosely refer to all of these as "raft state".
//   RangeLastReplicaGCTimestamp changes are ignored below, since it is
//   best-effort persistent state used to pace queues, and the caller is
//   allowed to mutate it out-of-band. However when deleting a replica,
//   ReplicasStorage will clear that key too. RangeLastReplicaGCTimestamp is
//   placed in this state category because it is not replicated state machine
//   state.
//
// The interface requires that any mutation (batch or sst) only touch one of
// these kinds of state. This discipline will allow us to eventually separate
// the engines containing these two kinds of state. This interface is not
// relevant for store local keys though they will be in the latter engine. The
// interface does not allow the caller to specify whether to sync a mutation
// to the raft log or state machine state -- that decision is left to the
// implementation of ReplicasStorage (with a couple of small exceptions where
// a sync is explicitly requested, which are explained later). So even when we
// don't separate the state machine and raft engines, this abstraction forces
// us to reason more carefully about effects of crashes, and when to sync, and
// allow us to test more thoroughly.
//
// RangeTombstoneKey: This is an unreplicated key that is critical to the
// replica lifecycle. Since it is unreplicated, it is not part of the state
// machine. However, placing it in the category of "raft state" with the other
// unreplicated keys turns out to be complicated:
// (a) in various range merge situations (including replicas being subsumed
// during snapshot application) we need to atomically move the state machine
// forward for the surviving range, delete the state machine state for the
// subsumed range(s) and set the RangeTombstone.
// (b) when removing a replica due to rebalancing we need to atomically remove
// the state machine and set the RangeTombstone.
// For these reasons, we require that the RangeTombstone be in the same engine
// as the state machine state. However, it can only be mutated by
// ReplicasStorage.
//
// Note that the interface is not currently designed such that raft log writes
// avoid syncing to disk as discussed in
// https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/17500#issuecomment-727094672
// and followup comments on that issue. However, having a clean storage
// abstraction should be a reasonable step in that direction.
//
// ReplicasStorage does not interpret most of the data in the state machine.
// It expects mutations to that state to be provided as an opaque batch, or a
// set of files to be ingested. There are a few exceptions where it can read
// state machine state, mainly when recovering from a crash, so as to make
// changes to get to a consistent state.
// - RangeAppliedStateKey: needs to read this in order to truncate the log,
//   both as part of regular log truncation (see the comment section on
//   "Normal Replica Operation") and on crash recovery (see the comment
//   section on "Replica Initialization" and "Crash Recovery" for details).
// - RangeDescriptorKey: needs to read this to discover the spans of
//   initialized replicas (see the comment sections on "Invariants" and "Crash
//   Recovery").
//
// A corollary to this lack of interpretation is that reads of the state
// machine are not handled by this interface, though it does expose some
// metadata in case the reader want to be sure that the replica it is trying
// to read actually exists in storage. ReplicasStorage also does not offer an
// interface to construct changes to the state machine state. It applies
// changes, and requires the caller to obey some simple invariants to not
// cause inconsistencies. It is aware of the keyspace occupied by a replica
// and the difference between rangeID keys and range keys -- it needs this
// awareness to discard (parts of) replica state when replicas are moved or
// merged away.
//
// ReplicasStorage does interpret the raft state (all the unreplicated
// range-ID local key names prefixed by Raft), and the RangeTombstoneKey. This
// is necessary for it to be able to maintain invariants spanning the raft log
// and the state machine (related to raft log truncation, replica lifetime
// etc.), including reapplying raft log entries on restart, to the state
// machine. All accesses (read or write) to the raft log and RangeTombstoneKey
// must happen via ReplicasStorage. ReplicasStorage does not by itself apply
// committed raft log entries to the state machine in a running system -- this
// is because state machine application in a running system has complex
// data-structure side-effects that are outside the scope of ReplicasStorage.

// It is told by the caller to apply a committed entry, which also requires
// the caller to provide the state machine changes. ReplicasStorage does apply
// "simple" entries directly to the state machine during Init to fix any
// inconsistency of the state machine caused by durable sst ingestion and
// non-durable batch application (see ApplyCommitted* methods in the
// interface). Since these could be preceded by non-durable configuration
// changes, the notion of "simple" entries includes configuration changes,
// except for splits and merges (which we sync to ensure durability -- this is
// justified in the section below on "Implementation constraints on
// ReplicasStorage").
//
// TODO(sumeer):
// https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/7625#issuecomment-489232411 relies
// on a correctness argument based on bounded regression of conf changes.
// Consider strengthening that correctness argument by making the committed
// index durable for a conf change before applying it. We could introduce a
// `ApplyConfChange(MutationBatch, highestRaftIndex uint64)` method, like we
// have for ingestion, and first sync the Commit state if needed. That way we
// will not have any conf change regression.
//
// ============================================================================
// Invariants:
//
// INVARIANT (RaftAndStateConsistency): when there is any data in the state
// machine associated with a given RangeID, there is a corresponding
// internally consistent Raft state (according to etcd/raft) that is also
// consistent with the applied state on the state machine (i.e. the latter
// references a valid log position). Specifically,
// - HardState.Commit >= RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex
// - if HardState.Commit > RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex, it points to an
//   entry in the raft log.
// - RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} must be a valid value corresponding to
//   what was truncated. If there are no raft log entries,
//   RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} must equal
//   RangeAppliedState.{RaftAppliedIndex,RaftAppliedIndexTerm}.
//
// INVARIANT (StateConsistency): when there is any data in the state machine
// associated with a given RangeID, it will reflect the replicated state at
// the corresponding applied index (i.e., it materializes the replicated log
// at this index).
// Additionally, a range is first created with a RangeDescriptor present
// (external invariant) and neither the callers nor ReplicasStorage will ever
// selectively delete it. NOTE: subsumption as part of a range merge does
// delete the RangeDescriptor, but the Replica atomically ceases to exist in
// the process.
// Specifically,
// - The state machine state must be consistent with the value of
//   RaftAppliedIndex, i.e., it equals a state generated from the full history
//   of this range (for a range that has never been the LHS of a merge, this
//   is the initial snapshot when the range came into being, followed by all
//   subsequent raft log entries).
// - RaftAppliedIndex >= raftInitialLogIndex
// - RaftAppliedIndexTerm >= raftInitialLogTerm
// - Has at least 1 non-provisional RangeDescriptor.
// - Regression of the HardState.Commit and RaftAppliedIndex is permitted due
//   to a crash except for the following:
//   - Split that has progressed to applying a state machine change that
//     results in a non-provisional RangeDescriptor for the RHS must not
//     regress after the crash (i.e., must sync application of the split
//     trigger).
//   - Merge that has progressed to applying a state machine change that
//     deletes the RangeDescriptor for the RHS must not regress after the
//     crash (i.e., must sync application of the merge trigger).
//   One could possibly relax these split/merge invariants but the corner
//   cases are very subtle and make it hard to reason about correctness.
//   As an example, see the discussion about "not syncing for splits" in
//   https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/72745#pullrequestreview-807989047
//
// INVARIANT (InterReplicaStateConsistency): The latest non-provisional
// RangeDescriptors of replicas with state machine state have spans that do
// not overlap. We use the term replica-descriptor to refer to this latest
// non-provisional RangeDescriptor, in the text below.
//
// DEFINITION (InitializedStateMachine): a Replica with state
// InitializedStateMachine, has state machine state and obeys the invariants
// RaftAndStateConsistency, StateConsistency, InterReplicaStateConsistency.
//
// DEFINITION (DeletedReplica): it can be convenient to reference Replicas
// that once existed but no longer do, as evidenced by the presence of a
// RangeTombstone for a RangeID, but no state machine or raft state.
// RangeTombstone.NextReplicaID is populated with a value > the last ReplicaID
// seen by ReplicasStorage for this range. Note that RangeTombstone is
// populated even for ranges that no longer exist (RHS of a merge) -- in this
// case it is set to a constant (mergedTombstoneReplicaID, equal to MaxInt32).
//
// DEFINITION (UninitializedStateMachine): this is a Replica with no state
// machine, i.e., there is Raft state and possibly a RangeTombstone. In
// particular, there is no RangeDescriptor and so it has no key span
// associated with it yet.
// The HardState{Term,Vote} can have arbitrary values since this replica can
// vote. However, it has a zero HardState.Commit and no log entries -- this
// Raft invariant is upheld externally by a combination of mostly external
// invariants:
// A new Range is initialized with all Replicas at truncated index equal to
// raftInitialLogIndex (10) (so they are in InitializedStateMachine state),
// and any future Replicas will be initialized via a snapshot reflecting a
// nonzero applied index >= 10. In particular, prior to receiving the
// snapshot, no log entries can be sent to the Replica. And etcd/raft only
// communicates Commit entries for which the recipient has the log entry.
//
//
// Some of the above invariants may be violated when non-durable state is lost
// due to a crash, but ReplicasStorage.Init is required to fix the persistent
// state such that the above invariants are true. These are not exposed to the
// user of the interface. We list these below.
//
// DEFINITION (RecoveryDeletingReplica): a Replica whose Raft state requires a
// nonzero applied index in the state machine, but there is no state machine
// state. This is an intermediate state entered when transitioning from
// InitializedStateMachine to DeletedReplica, after the state machine state
// has been deleted and RangeTombstoneKey updated and before the raft state
// has been deleted. This is distinguishable from UninitializedStateMachine
// since RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} are guaranteed to exist and have
// values >= raftInitialLogIndex, raftInitialLogTerm. ReplicasStorage.Init
// will transition out of this state into DeletedReplica state.
//
// DEFINITION (RecoveryInconsistentReplica): This is a Replica that mostly
// looks like to be in state InitializedStateMachine, but has suffered
// regression in durable state such that the state machine has advanced past
// HardState.Commit, or a snapshot has been applied and all raft log entries
// are < RaftAppliedIndex, i.e., it violates RaftAndStateConsistency
// invariants. More severely, it can also violate StateConsistency invariants
// by having durably ingested SSTables but not yet updated the
// RaftAppliedIndex to reflect that state machine change. ReplicasStorage.Init
// restores all the invariants needed by an InitializedStateMachine replica,
// by fixing the raft log to be consistent with the state machine, and
// re-applying log entries up to HardState.Commit (except for log entries that
// indicate a split or merge -- see below).
//
// Replica state transitions:
// - Initial state: UninitializedStateMachine
// - Final state: DeletedReplica
// - UninitializedStateMachine => DeletedReplica, InitializedStateMachine
// - InitializedStateMachine => RecoveryDeletingReplica, RecoveryInconsistentReplica
// - RecoveryDeletingReplica => DeletedReplica
// - RecoveryInconsistentReplica => InitializedStateMachine
//
// ============================================================================
// Implementation constraints on ReplicasStorage:
// - Splits and Merges typically happen by applying an entry in the raft log.
//   It is feasible for ReplicasStorage.Init to apply such committed entries.
//   However, the logic in such cases can add additional mutations to the
//   batch in the raft log, that have nothing to do with the normal scope of
//   what ReplicasStorage is concerned with. For example, splitPreApply has
//   logic to set RangeAppliedState.RaftClosedTimestamp. For this reason
//   ReplicasStorage ensures durability of split/merge application and does
//   not apply any Split/Merge log entries in ReplicasStorage.Init.
//
// ============================================================================
// Replica Initialization:
//
// Since ReplicasStorage does not permit atomic updates spanning the state
// machine and raft state (even if they are a single engine), replica creation
// is sequenced as (* indicates durable writes):
//
// - [C1*] creation of RaftHardStateKey in raft state with
//   {Term:0,Vote:0,Commit:0}. This is a replica in UninitializedStateMachine
//   state.
// - [C2*] creation of state machine state (via snapshot or some synthesized
//   state for rangeID and range local keys in the case of split).
// - [C3] set RaftTruncatedStateKey with RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} equal
//   to RangeAppliedState.{RaftAppliedIndex,RaftAppliedIndexTerm} and adjust
//   of RaftHardStateKey (specifically HardState.Commit needs to be set to
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex -- see below for details). Also
//   discard all raft log entries if any (see below). At this point the
//   replica is in InitializedStateMachine state.
//
// Every step above needs to be atomic. Note that we are doing 2 syncs, in
// steps C1 and C2, for the split case, where we currently do 1 sync -- splits
// are not common enough for this to matter. If we did not sync C2 we could
// start adding log entries after C3 but lose the state machine state in the
// case of a crash, which would violate the replica state invariants.
//
// An initialized replica that receives a snapshot because it has lagged
// behind will execute C2 and C3. The C3 step throws away all the existing
// raft log entries. So a precondition for applying such a snapshot is:
// - The raft log does not have entries beyond the snapshot's
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex. If it did, there would be no benefit
//   in applying this snapshot.
//   The following etcd/raft code
//   https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/7572a61a39d4eaad596ab8d9364f7df9a84ff4a3/raft/raft.go#L1584-L1589
//   ensures this behavior -- if the raft log entry corresponding to the
//   snapshot is already present locally, it only advances the commit index to
//   the snapshot index, and does not actually apply the snapshot.
// - Corollary: since HardState.Commit cannot refer to log entries beyond the
//   locally persisted ones, the existing HardState.Commit <=
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex, so the HardState manipulation done in
//   step C3 will only need to increase the value of HardState.Commit.
//
// Why C2 before C3?:
// If we performed step C3 before C2, there is a possibility that a crash
// prevents C2. Now we would need to rollback the change made in C3 to reach a
// fully consistent state on crash recovery. Rolling back HardState.Commit is
// easy, since there is no raft log, we can set it to
// RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex if it exists, else 0. Similarly, we can
// rollback RaftTruncatedState by either:
// - deleting it if the RangeAppliedState does not exist, which implies C3 did
//   not happen.
// - if RangeAppliedState exists, roll back RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} to
//   RangeAppliedState.{RaftAppliedIndex,RaftAppliedIndexTerm}. Note that this
//   is a case where an already initialized lagging replica has a snapshot
//   being applied.
// The correctness problem with doing C3 before C2 is that the store violates
// raft promises it has made earlier. For example, if the state machine had
// applied index 20 and the raft log contained [15, 25), then this store is
// part of the quorum that causes [21, 25) to commit. If after the crash this
// store has applied index 20 and has no raft state, it is in effect an
// unavailable replica, since it no longer has [21, 25).
//
// Rolling forward if crash after C2 and before C3:
// ReplicasStorage.Init will roll forward to C3 when initializing itself.
// - If HardState.Commit < RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex, update
//   HardState.Commit
// - If RaftTruncatedState does not exist, or RaftTruncatedState.Index <
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex and all log entries are <=
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex
//   - Discard all raft log entries.
//   - Set RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} using
//     RangeAppliedState.{RaftAppliedIndex,RaftAppliedIndexTerm}
//
// Aside:
// Since we now have RangeAppliesState.RaftAppliedIndexTerm, constructing an
// outgoing snapshot only involves reading state machine state (this is a tiny
// bit related to #72222, in that we are also assuming here that the outgoing
// snapshot is constructed purely by reading state machine engine state).
//
// ============================================================================
// Replica Deletion:
//
// Replica deletion is sequenced as the following steps (* indicates durable
// writes):

// - [D1*] deletion of state machine state (iff the replica is in state
//   InitializedStateMachine) and write to the RangeTombstoneKey. If prior to
//   this step the range was in state InitializedStateMachine, it is now in
//   state RecoveryDeletingReplica. If it was in state UninitializedStateMachine,
//   it continues to be in the same state (but with a RangeTombstone that will
//   prevent this replica from ever transitioning to InitializedStateMachine).
//   This latter case can occur for various reasons: one cause is this range
//   is the RHS of a split where the split has not yet happened, but we've
//   created an uninitialized RHS. So we can't delete the state machine state
//   for the RHS since it doesn't exist yet (there is some replicated state in
//   the state machine that could in the future belong to the RHS, but not
//   yet, and we don't know the span of that future RHS either). By updating
//   the RangeTombstone, when the split occurs, D1 will be repeated.
//   - This step will only delete the RangeID local keys, when this replica
//     deletion is due to a merge (the range itself is being deleted).
// - [D2] deletion of all Raft state for this RangeID, i.e., RaftHardStateKey,
//   RaftTruncatedStateKey, log entries, RangeLastReplicaGCTimestampKey.
//
// Every step above needs to be atomic. One of the reasons to sync after D1 it
// that we could later execute C1 when adding the range back to this store, and
// then crash. On crash recovery we'd find the raft HardState and old state
// machine state and incorrectly think this is an initialized replica.
//
// Note that we don't delete the RangeTombstoneKey even when the range itself
// is being deleted (due to a merge). The replay protection offered by it is
// more important than the minuscule cost of leaking a RangeTombstoneKey per
// range. It is possible to have some cleanup of RangeTombstoneKeys for long
// dead ranges, but it is outside of the scope here.
//
// A crash after D1 will result in a replica either in state
// RecoveryDeletingReplica or UninitializedStateMachine. For the latter, some
// code above ReplicasStorage will eventually ask for the replica to be
// cleaned up (see https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/73424 for
// cleanup improvement). For the former, ReplicasStorage.Init will execute D2.
//
// ============================================================================
// Normal Replica Operation:
//
// - ReplicasStorage is used to append/replace log entries and update
//   HardState. This is done via a RaftMutationBatch. There is a
//   RaftMutationBatch.MustSync that the caller uses to specify the minimal
//   sync requirements imposed by Raft (ReplicasStorage is not in the business
//   of understanding Raft correctness requirements). Typically MustSync will
//   be true only if entries are appended, or a vote and/or term change has to
//   be recorded. In particular, a change solely to HardState.Commit would
//   have MustSync=false. See
//   https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/7572a61a39d4eaad596ab8d9364f7df9a84ff4a3/raft/node.go#L584-L593.
//   Note that this means that HardState.Commit can regress and become less
//   than RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex in case of a crash. We will fix
//   this in ReplicasStorage.Init, as discussed later.
//
// - The caller keeps track of HardState.Commit, since it constructed
//   HardState for the RaftMutationBatch. It applies committed entries to the
//   state machine using ApplyCommittedUsingIngest and ApplyCommittedBatch.
//   The ApplyCommitted* methods should not be used for log entries that are
//   performing splits or merges -- the caller should do those by calling
//   SplitReplica and MergeReplicas. ReplicasStorage decides when it is
//   necessary to sync -- ApplyCommitted* will not sync the state machine, and
//   SplitReplica/MergeReplicas will sync the state machine. Note that the
//   caller may not need to read a raft entry from ReplicasStorage in order to
//   apply it, if it happens to have stashed it somewhere in its in-memory
//   data-structures.
//
//   For log entries that are ingesting side-loaded files, the application of
//   a single entry is split into a pair, ApplyCommittedUsingIngest, that
//   usually does not update the RaftAppliedIndex and then ApplyCommittedBatch
//   which updates the RaftAppliedIndex. A crash after the first and before
//   the second leaves the state machine in an inconsistent state
//   (RecoveryInconsistentReplica) which needs to be fixed by
//   ReplicasStorage.Init. For this reason, ReplicasStorage keeps track of the
//   highest HardState.Commit known to be durable, and requires
//   ApplyCommittedUsingIngest to provide the highestRaftIndex of the changes
//   included in the files. ReplicasStorage will sync the raft state if
//   needed, to make the highestRaftIndex durable, before ingesting these
//   files. This prevents regression of HardState.Commit past an index that
//   contains side-loaded files. Note that this assumes that
//   ReplicasStorage.Init has the capability of applying all raft log entries
//   except for splits and merges (we've already mentioned that splits/merges
//   are made durable at application time).
//
// - Log truncation is advised by the caller, based on various signals
//   relevant to the proper functioning of the distributed raft group, except
//   that the caller is unaware of what is durable in the state machine. Hence
//   the advise provided by the caller serves as an upper bound of what can be
//   truncated. Log truncation does not need to be synced. The implementation
//   of ReplicasStorage reads the durable state of
//   RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex to use as an additional upper bound of
//   what can be truncated.
//
// - Range merges impose an additional requirement: the merge protocol (at a
//   higher layer) needs the RHS replica of a merge to have applied all raft
//   entries up to a specified index and that this application is durable. To
//   ensure the durability we expose a SyncStateMachine method for the higher
//   layer.
//
// ============================================================================
// Crash Recovery:
// ReplicasStorage needs to be self contained in the sense that it must be
// able to execute state changes to reach a fully consistent state without
// needing any external input, as part of its initialization. Init will block
// until all the raft and state machine states have been made mutually
// consistent.
// - Iterate over RaftHardStateKeys and identify a set of replicas R_r. This
//   is efficiently done by seeking to the current RangeID+1.
// - Iterate over RangeDescriptorKeys and identify a set of replicas R_s. This
//   is efficiently done by using the latest non-provisional RangeDescriptor
//   (replica-descriptor) of the current range and then seeking to the end key
//   of the range's span.
//   - Note that this way of skipping spans will ensure that we will not find
//     RangeDescriptors that have overlapping spans, which is ideally an invariant
//     we should verify. Instead of verifying that invariant, which is expensive,
//     we can additionally iterate over all the RangeAppliedStateKeys, which are
//     RangeID local keys -- this iteration can be accomplished by seeking using
//     current RangeID+1. If we find RangeAppliedStateKeys whose RangeID is not
//     mentioned in a corresponding RangeDescriptor we have an invariant violation.
// - The set R_s - R_r must be empty, i.e., R_s is a subset of R_r.
// - The set R_r - R_s are replicas are either in state
//   UninitializedStateMachine or RecoveryDeletingReplica.
// - Remove RecoveryDeletingReplica replicas by transitioning them to DeletedReplica
//   by executing D2.
// - The set R_s are replicas that ought to be in state
//   InitializedStateMachine, though may have been in the middle of that state
//   transition, or become inconsistent for other reasons mentioned earlier.
//   That is, they are potentially in RecoveryInconsistentReplica state.
//   - If RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex > HardState.Commit (or there is
//     no HardState), execute the following atomically:
//     - If there are no log entries or all log entries are <
//       RaftAppliedIndex: remove all log entries and set
//       RaftTruncatedState.{Index,Term} equal to
//       RangeAppliedState.{RaftAppliedIndex,RaftAppliedIndexTerm}.
//     - Set HardState.Commit to RaftAppliedIndex.
//     These steps handle (a) crash in the middle of replica creation (doing
//     step C3), and (b) regression of HardState.Commit under normal replica
//     operation. The RaftAndStateConsistency invariant now holds.
//   - The StateConsistency invariant may not hold. To ensure that it holds:
//     for ranges whose RangeAppliedState.RaftAppliedIndex < HardState.Commit,
//     apply log entries, including those that remove this replica, until one
//     encounters a log entry that is performing a split or merge.
// - InitializedStateMachine replicas:
//   - using the replica-descriptors, check that the spans do not overlap.
//   - This InterReplicaStateConsistency invariant must also hold before we
//     fixed the RecoveryInconsistentReplicas, so we could additionally check
//     it then.
