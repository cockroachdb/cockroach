	// they have a "real" issue with a previous lease. Example: Assuming no

	// effectively gets the lease for [0, 15), which the second one can commit

	// the old lease. This allows multiple requests from the same replica to

		// receive an error under the new lease by making sure the sequence number
		// of that lease is higher. This in turn is achieved by forwarding its start
		// time here, which makes it not Equivalent() to the preceding lease for the
		// same store.
		//
		// Note also that leasePostApply makes sure to update the timestamp cache in
		// this case: even though the lease holder does not change, the the sequence

		// The bug prevented with this is unlikely to occur in practice
