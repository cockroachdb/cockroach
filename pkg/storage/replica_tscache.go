// CanCreateTxnRecord determines whether a transaction record can be created for
// the provided transaction information. Callers must provide the transaction's
// minimum timestamp across all epochs, along with its ID and its key.
//
// If the method return true, it also returns the minimum provisional commit
// timestamp that the record can be created with. If the method returns false,
// it returns the reason that transaction record was rejected. If the method
// ever determines that a transaction record must be rejected, it will continue
// to reject that transaction going forwards.
//
// The method performs two critical roles:
// 1. It protects against replayed requests or new requests from a transaction's
//    coordinator that could otherwise cause a transaction record to be created
//    after the transaction has already been finalized and its record cleaned up.
// 2. It serves as the mechanism by which successful push requests convey
//    information to transactions who have not yet written their transaction
//    record. In doing so, it ensures that transaction records are created with a
//    sufficiently high timestamp after a successful PushTxn(TIMESTAMP) and ensures
//    that transactions records are never created at all after a successful
//    PushTxn(ABORT). As a result of this mechanism, a transaction never needs to
//    explicitly create the transaction record for contending transactions.

//
// In the diagram, CanCreateTxnRecord is consulted in all three of the
// state transitions that move away from the "no txn record" state.
// Updating v1 and v2 is performed in updateTimestampCache.
//
// The are three separate simplifications to the transaction model that would
// allow us to simplify this state machine:
//
// 1. as discussed on the comment on txnHeartbeater, it is reasonable to expect
//    that we will eventually move away from tracking transaction liveness on a
//    per-transaction basis. This means that we would no longer need transaction
//    heartbeats and would never need to write a transaction record until a
//    transaction is ready to complete.
//
// 2. one of the two possibilities for the "txn record written [finalized]" state
//    is that the transaction record is aborted. There used to be two reasons to
//    persist transaction records with the ABORTED status. The first was because
//    doing so was the only way for concurrent actors to prevent the record from
//    being re-written by the transaction going forward. The concurrent actor would
//    write an aborted transaction record and then wait for the GC to clean it up
//    later. The other reasons for writing the transaction records with the ABORTED
//    status was because these records could point at intents, which assisted the
//    cleanup process for these intents. However, this only held for ABORTED
//    records written on behalf of the transaction coordinator itself. If a
//    transaction was aborted by a concurrent actor, its record would not
//    immediately contain any of the transaction's intents.
//
//    The first reason here no longer holds. Concurrent actors now bump the write
//    timestamp cache when aborting a transaction, which has the same effect as
//    writing an ABORTED transaction record. The second reason still holds but is
//    fairly weak. A transaction coordinator can kick off intent resolution for an
//    aborted transaction without needing to write these intents into the record
//    itself. In the worst case, this intent resolution fails and each intent is
//    cleaned up individually as it is discovered. All in all, neither
//    justification for this state holds much weight anymore.
//
// 3. the other possibility for the "txn record written [finalized]" state is that
//    the transaction record is committed. This state is currently critical for the
//    transaction model because intent resolution cannot begin before a transaction
//    record enters this state. However, this doesn't need to be the case forever.
//    There are proposals to modify the state of committed key-value writes
//    slightly such that intent resolution could be run for implicitly committed
//    transactions while their transaction record remains in the  "txn record
//    written [staging]" state. For this to work, the recovery mechanism for
//    indeterminate commit errors would need to be able to determine whether an
//    intent or a **committed value** indicated the success of a write that was
//    in-flight at the time the transaction record was staged. This poses
//    challenges migration and garbage collection, but it would have a number of
//    performance benefits.
//
// If we were to perform change #1, we could remove the "txn record written
// [pending]" state. If we were to perform change #2 and #3, we could remove the
// "txn record written [finalized]" state. All together, this would leave us
// with only two states that the transaction record could be in, written or not
// written. At that point, it begins to closely resemble any other write in the
// system.
