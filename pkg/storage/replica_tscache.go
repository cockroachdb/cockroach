// CanCreateTxnRecord determines whether a transaction record can be created
// for the provided transaction information. Callers should provide an upper
// bound on the transaction's minimum timestamp across all epochs (typically
// the original timestamp of its first epoch). If this is not exact then the
// method may return false positives (i.e. it determines that the record could
// be created when it actually couldn't) but will never return false negatives
// (i.e. it will never determine that the record could not be created when it
// actually could).
//
// Because of this, callers who intend to write the transaction record should
// always provide an exact minimum timestamp. They can't provide their
// provisional commit timestamp because it may have moved forward over the
// course of a single epoch and they can't provide their (current epoch's)
// OrigTimestamp because it may have moved forward over a series of prior
// epochs. Either of these timestamps might be above the timestamp that a
// successful aborter might have used when aborting the transaction. Instead,
// they should provide their epoch-zero original timestamp.
//
// If the method return true, it also returns the minimum provisional commit
// timestamp that the record can be created with. If the method returns false,
// it returns the reason that transaction record was rejected. If the method
// ever determines that a transaction record must be rejected, it will continue
// to reject that transaction going forwards.
//
// The method performs two critical roles:
// 1. It protects against replayed requests or new requests from a transaction's
//    coordinator that could otherwise cause a transaction record to be created
//    after the transaction has already been finalized and its record cleaned up.
// 2. It serves as the mechanism by which successful push requests convey
//    information to transactions who have not yet written their transaction
//    record. In doing so, it ensures that transaction records are created with a
//    sufficiently high timestamp after a successful PushTxn(TIMESTAMP) and ensures
//    that transactions records are never created at all after a successful
//    PushTxn(ABORT). As a result of this mechanism, a transaction never needs to
//    explicitly create the transaction record for contending transactions.
