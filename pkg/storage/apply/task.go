// StateMachine represents an instance of a replicated state machine being

// have been committed to the replication group's log and applies them to
// advance to a new state.

// deterministic, which ensures that if each instance is driven from the
// same consistent shared log, they will all stay in sync.

	//
	// Batch comes in two flavors - real batches and ephemeral batches.
	// Real batches are capable of accumulating updates from commands and
	// applying them to the state machine. Ephemeral batches are not able
	// to make changes to the durable state machine, but can still be used

// AckCommittedEntriesBeforeApplication attempts to acknowledge the success of
// raft entries that have been durably committed to the raft log but have not
// yet been applied to the proposer replica's replicated state machine.
//
// This is safe because a proposal through raft can be known to have succeeded
// as soon as it is durably replicated to a quorum of replicas (i.e. has
// committed in the raft log). The proposal does not need to wait for the
// effects of the proposal to be applied in order to know whether its changes
// will succeed or fail. This is because the raft log is the provider of
// atomicity and durability for replicated writes, not (ignoring log
// truncation) the replicated state machine itself.
//
// However, there are a few complications to acknowledging the success of a
// proposal at this stage:
//
//  1. Committing an entry in the raft log and having the command in that entry
//     succeed are similar but not equivalent concepts. Even if the entry succeeds
//     in achieving durability by replicating to a quorum of replicas, its command
//     may still be rejected "beneath raft". This means that a (deterministic)
//     check after replication decides that the command will not be applied to the
//     replicated state machine. In that case, the client waiting on the result of
//     the command should not be informed of its success. Luckily, this check is
//     cheap to perform so we can do it here and when applying the command.
//
//     Determining whether the command will succeed or be rejected before applying
//     it for real is accomplished using an ephemeral batch. Commands are staged in
//     the ephemeral batch to acquire CheckedCommands, which can then be acknowledged
//     immediately even though the ephemeral batch itself cannot be used to update
//     the durable state machine. Once the rejection status of each command is
//     determined, any successful commands that permit acknowledgement before
//     application (see CanAckBeforeApplication) are acknowledged. The ephemeral
//     batch is then thrown away.
//
//  2. Some commands perform non-trivial work such as updating Replica configuration
//     state or performing Range splits. In those cases, it's likely that the client
//     is interested in not only knowing whether it has succeeded in sequencing the
//     change in the raft log, but also in knowing when the change has gone into
//     effect. There's currently no exposed hook to ask for an acknowledgement only
//     after a command has been applied, so for simplicity the current implementation
//     only ever acks transactional writes before they have gone into effect. All
//     other commands wait until they have been applied to ack their client.
//
//  3. Even though we can determine whether a command has succeeded without applying
//     it, the effect of the command will not be visible to conflicting commands until
//     it is applied. Because of this, the client can be informed of the success of
//     a write at this point, but we cannot release that write's latches until the
//     write has applied. See ProposalData.signalProposalResult/finishApplication.
//
//  4. etcd/raft may provided a series of CommittedEntries in a Ready struct that
//     haven't actually been appended to our own log. This is most common in single
//     node replication groups, but it is possible when a follower in a multi-node
//     replication group is catching up after falling behind. In the first case,
//     the entries are not yet committed so acknowledging them would be a lie. In
//     the second case, the entries are committed so we could acknowledge them at
//     this point, but doing so seems risky. To avoid complications in either case,
//     the method takes a maxIndex parameter that limits the indexes that it will
//     acknowledge. Typically, callers will supply the highest index that they have
//     durably written to their raft log for this upper bound.
