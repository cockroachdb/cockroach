// Cache is a bounded in-memory cache that records the maximum timestamp that
// key ranges were read from and written to. The structure serves to protect
// against violations of Snapshot Isolation, which requires that the outcome of
// reads must be preserved even in the presence of read-write conflicts (i.e. a
// write to a key at a lower timestamp than a previous read must not succeed).
// Cache corresponds to the "status oracle" discussed in Yabandeh's A Critique
// of Snapshot Isolation.
//
// The cache is updated after the completion of each read operation with the
// range of all keys that the request was predicated upon. It is then consulted
// for each write operation, allowing them to detect read-write violations that
// would allow them to write "under" a read that has already been performed.
//
// The cache is size-limited, so to prevent read-write conflicts for arbitrarily
// old requests, it pessimistically maintains a “low water mark”. This value
// always ratchets with monotonic increases and is equivalent to the earliest
// timestamp of any key range that is present in the cache. If a write operation
// writes to a key not present in the cache, the “low water mark” is consulted
// instead to determine read-write conflicts. The low water mark is initialized
// to the current system time plus the maximum clock offset.
//
// All Cache implementations are safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
