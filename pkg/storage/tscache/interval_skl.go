// intervalSkl efficiently tracks the latest logical time at which any key or

// will never decrease. In other words, if a lookup returns timestamp A and
// repeating the same lookup returns timestamp B, then B >= A.
//
// Add and lookup operations do not block or interfere with one another, which
// enables predictable operation latencies. Also, the impact of the structure on
// the GC is virtually nothing, even when the structure is very large. These
// properties are enabled by employing a lock-free skiplist implementation that
// uses an arena allocator. Skiplist nodes refer to one another by offset into
// the arena rather than by pointer, so the GC has very few objects to track.

// (see interval.Comparable) and the value implements a Ratchetable interface:
//
//   type Ratchetable interface {
//     Ratchet(other Ratchetable) (changed bool)
//   }

// In other words, if Go supported zero-cost abstractions, this type might look
// like:
//
//   type intervalSkl<K: Comparable, V: Ratchetable>

// scanForMaxValue scans for the maximum value in the specified range. It does
// so by first scanning backwards to the first initialized node and using its
// gap value as the initial "previous gap value". It then scans forward until it
// reaches the "from" key, ratcheting any uninitialized nodes it encounters (but
// not initializing them), and updating the candidate "previous gap value" as it
// goes. Once the scan enters the specified range, it begins keeping track of
// the maximum value that it has seen, which is initially set to the "previous
// gap value". It ratchets this maximum value with each new value that it
// encounters while iterating between "from" and "to", returning the final
// maximum when the iteration reaches the end of the range.
//
// Iterating backwards and then forwards solves potential race conditions with
// other threads. During backwards iteration, other nodes can be inserting new
// nodes between the previous node and the lookup node, which could change the
// choice for the "previous gap value". The solution is two-fold:
//
// 1. Add new nodes in two phases - initializing and then initialized. Nodes in
//    the initializing state act as a synchronization point between goroutines
//    that are adding a particular node and goroutines that are scanning for gap
//    values. Scanning goroutines encounter the initializing nodes and are
//    forced to ratchet them before continuing.
//
//    However, only the goroutine that inserted a node can switch it from
//    initializing to initialized. This enforces a "happens-before" relationship
//    between the creation of a node and the discovery of the gap value that is
//    used when initializing it. If any goroutine was able to initialize a node,
//    then this relationship would not exist and we could experience races where
//    a newly inserted node A's call to ensureFloorValue could come before the
//    insertion of a node B, but node B could be initialized with a gap value
//    discovered before the insertion of node A. For more on this, see the
//    discussion in #19672.
//
// 2. After the gap value of the first initialized node with a key less than or
//    equal to "from" has been found, the scanning goroutine will scan forwards
//    until it reaches the original "from" key. It will ratchet any
//    uninitialized nodes along the way and inherit the gap value from them as
//    it goes. By the time it reaches the original key, it has a valid gap
//    value, which we have called the "previous gap value". At this point, if
//    the node at "from" is uninitialized and initFrom == true, the node can be
//    initialized with the "previous gap value".
//
//    With the gap value for the first node in the range bounds determined, the
//    scan can then continue over the rest of the range, keeping track of the
//    maximum value seen between "from" and "to".
//
// During forward iteration, if another goroutine inserts a new gap node in the
// interval between the previous node and the original key, then either:
//
// 1. The forward iteration finds it and looks up its gap value. That node's gap
//    value now becomes the new "previous gap value", and iteration continues.
//
// 2. The new node is created after the iterator has move past its position. As
//    part of node creation, the creator had to scan backwards to find the gap
//    value of the previous node. It is guaranteed to find a gap value that is
//    >= the gap value found by the original goroutine.
//
// This means that no matter what gets inserted, or when it gets inserted, the
// scanning goroutine is guaranteed to end up with a value that will never
// decrease on future lookups, which is the critical invariant.
//
// The method takes arguments to specify a range to scan over. It is not legal
// to pass nil as the "from" argument or for "from" > "to". It also takes an
// "initFrom" flag, which specifies whether an uninitialized node at key "from"
// should be initialized, if one is discovered. The iterator is expected be
// positioned at "from" if a node exists at that key in the skiplist. If not, it
// is expected to be positioned on the preceding node.
