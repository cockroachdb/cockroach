// intervalSkl efficiently tracks the latest logical time at which any key or

// data structure guarantees that the read timestamp of any given key or range
// will never decrease. In other words, if a lookup returns timestamp A and
// repeating the same lookup returns timestamp B, then B >= A.
//
// Add and lookup operations do not block or interfere with one another, which
// enables predictable operation latencies. Also, the impact of the structure on
// the GC is virtually nothing, even when the structure is very large. These

//     Ratchet(other Ratchetable) (changed bool)
//   }

// nodes between the previous node and the lookup node, which could change the
// correct value of the gap timestamp. The solution is two-fold:
//
// 1. Add new nodes in two phases - initializing and then initialized. Nodes in
//    the initializing state act as a synchronization point between goroutines
//    that are adding a particular node and goroutines that are scanning for gap
//    timestamps. Scanning goroutines encounter the initializing nodes and are
//    forced to deal with them before continuing.
//
// 2. After the gap timestamp of the previous node has been found, the scanning
//    goroutine will scan forwards until it reaches the original key. It will
//    complete initialization of any nodes along the way and inherit the gap
//    timestamp of initialized nodes as it goes. By the time it reaches the
//    original key, it has a valid gap timestamp value.
//
// During forward iteration, if another goroutine inserts a new gap node in the
// interval between the previous node and the original key, then either:
//
// 1. The forward iteration finds it and looks up its gap timestamp. That node
//    now becomes the new "previous node", and iteration continues.
//
// 2. The new node is created after the iterator has move past its position. As
//    part of node creation, the creator had to scan backwards to find the gap
//    timestamp of the previous node. It is guaranteed to find a gap timestamp
//    that is >= the gap timestamp found by the original goroutine.

// never decrease on future lookups, which is the critical invariant.
