// intervalSkl efficiently tracks the latest logical time at which any key or

// will never decrease. In other words, if a lookup returns timestamp A and
// repeating the same lookup returns timestamp B, then B >= A.
//
// Add and lookup operations do not block or interfere with one another, which
// enables predictable operation latencies. Also, the impact of the structure on
// the GC is virtually nothing, even when the structure is very large. These
// properties are enabled by employing a lock-free skiplist implementation that
// uses an arena allocator. Skiplist nodes refer to one another by offset into
// the arena rather than by pointer, so the GC has very few objects to track.

// (see interval.Comparable) and the value implements a Ratchetable interface:
//
//   type Ratchetable interface {
//     Ratchet(other Ratchetable) (changed bool)

// In other words, if Go supported zero-cost abstractions, this type might look
// like:

//
// Iterating backwards and then forwards solves potential race conditions with
// other threads. During backwards iteration, other nodes can be inserting new
// nodes between the previous node and the lookup node, which could change the
// choice for the "previous gap value". The solution is two-fold:
//
// 1. Add new nodes in two phases - initializing and then initialized. Nodes in
//    the initializing state act as a synchronization point between goroutines
//    that are adding a particular node and goroutines that are scanning for gap
//    values. Scanning goroutines encounter the initializing nodes and are
//    forced to ratchet them before continuing. If they fail to ratchet them
//    because an arena is full, the nodes must never be initialized so they are
//    set to cantInit. This is critical for correctness, because if one of these
//    initializing nodes was not ratcheted when encountered during a forward
//    scan and later initialized, we could see a ratchet inversion. For example,
//    the inversion would occur if:
//    - 1: a goroutine is scanning forwards after finding a previous gap value
//         from node A in which it plans to initialize node C.
//    - 2: node B is created and initialized between node A and node C with a
//         larger value than either.
//    - 1: the iterator scanning forwards to node C is already past node B when
//         it is created.
//    - 3: a lookup for the timestamp of node C comes in. Since it's not
//         initialized, it uses node B's gap value.
//    - 1: the iterator reaches node C and initializes it with node A's gap
//         value, which is smaller than node B's.
//    - 4: another lookup for the timestamp of node C comes it. It returns the
//         nodes newly initialized value, which is smaller than the one it
//         reported before.
//    Ratcheting initializing nodes when encountered with the current gap value
//    avoids this race.
//
//    However, only a goroutine that saw a node in an uninitialized state before
//    scanning backwards can switch it from initializing to initialized. This
//    enforces a "happens-before" relationship between the creation of a node
//    and the discovery of the gap value that is used when initializing it. If
//    any goroutine was able to initialize a node, then this relationship would
//    not exist and we could experience races where a newly inserted node A's
//    call to ensureFloorValue could come before the insertion of a node B, but
//    node B could be initialized with a gap value discovered before the
//    insertion of node A. For more on this, see the discussion in #19672.
//
// 2. After the gap value of the first initialized node with a key less than or
//    equal to the desired key has been found, the scanning goroutine will scan
//    forwards until it reaches the original key. It will ratchet any
//    uninitialized nodes along the way and inherit the gap value from them as
//    it goes. By the time it reaches the original key, it has a valid gap
//    value, which we have called the "previous gap value". At this point, if
//    the node at key is uninitialized, the node can be initialized with the
//    "previous gap value".
