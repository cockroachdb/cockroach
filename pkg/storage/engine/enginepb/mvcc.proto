// don't change last_update_nanos until an update at a timestamp which,
// truncated to the second, is ahead of last_update_nanos/1e9. Then, that
// difference in seconds times the base quantity (excluding the currently
// running update) is added to the age. It gets more complicated when data is
// accounted for with a timestamp behind last_update_nanos. In this case, if
// more than a second has passed (computed via truncation above), the ages have
// to be adjusted to account for this late addition. This isn't hard: add the
// new data's base quantity times the (truncated) number of seconds behind.
