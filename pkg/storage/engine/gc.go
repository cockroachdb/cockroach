// timestamp including, and after which, all values should be garbage
// collected. If no values should be GC'd, returns -1 for the index
// and the zero timestamp. Keys must be in descending time
// order. Values deleted at or before the returned timestamp can be
// deleted without invalidating any reads in the time interval
// (gc.expiration, \infinity).
//
// The GC keeps all values (including deletes) above the expiration time, plus
// the first value before or at the expiration time. This allows reads to be
// guaranteed as described above. However if this were the only rule, then if
// the most recent write was a delete, it would never be removed. Thus, when a
// deleted value is the most recent before expiration, it can be deleted. This
// would still allow for the tombstone bugs in #6227, so in the future we will
// add checks that disallow writes before the last GC expiration time.
