						//
						// 1. Only the lease holder (at the time) schedules removal of a replica,
						// but the lease can change hands and so the situation in which a follower
						// coordinates a replica removal of the (new) lease holder is possible (if
						// unlikely) in practice. In this situation, the new lease holder would at
						// some point be asked to propose the replica change's EndTransaction to
						// Raft. A check has been added that prevents proposals that amount to the
						// removal of the proposer's (and hence lease holder's) Replica, preventing
						// this scenario.
						//
						// 2. A lease is accepted for a Replica that has been removed. Without
						// precautions, this could happen because lease requests are special in
						// that they are the only command that is proposed on a follower (other
						// commands may be proposed from followers, but not successfully so). For
						// all proposals, processRaftCommand checks that their ProposalLease is
						// compatible with the active lease for the log position. For commands
						// proposed on the lease holder, the spanlatch manager then serializes
						// everything. But lease requests get created on followers based on their
						// local state and thus without being sequenced through latching. Thus
						// a recently removed follower (unaware of its own removal) could submit
						// a proposal for the lease (correctly using as a ProposerLease the last
						// active lease), and would receive it given the up-to-date ProposerLease.
						// Hence, an extra check is in order: processRaftCommand makes sure that
						// lease requests for a replica not in the descriptor are bounced.
