// leaseholder maintaining its node liveness record (also a lease, but
// at the node level). All ranges up to and including the node
// liveness table must use expiration-based leases to avoid any
// circular dependencies. Note that ranges can be changed from using
// expiration-based to epoch-based leases and vice versa via the
// environment variable COCKROACH_ENABLE_EPOCH_RANGE_LEASES.

// - The lease is considered in stasis if the timestamp is within the

//
// - The lease is considered expired in all other cases.

// avoid a failure of linearizability on a single register during
// lease changes. Without that stasis period, the following could
// occur:
//
// * a range lease gets committed on the new lease holder (but not the old).
// * client proposes and commits a write on new lease holder (with a
//   timestamp just greater than the expiration of the old lease).
// * client tries to read what it wrote, but hits a slow coordinator
//   (which assigns a timestamp covered by the old lease).
// * the read is served by the old lease holder (which has not
//   processed the change in lease holdership).
