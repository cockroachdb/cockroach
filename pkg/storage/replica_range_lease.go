// This file contains replica methods related to range leases.
//
// Here be dragons: The lease system (especially for epoch-based
// leases) relies on multiple interlocking conditional puts (here and
// in NodeLiveness). Reads (to get expected values) and conditional
// puts have to happen in a certain order, leading to surprising
// dependencies at a distance (for example, there's a LeaseStatus
// object that gets plumbed most of the way through this file.
// LeaseStatus bundles the results of multiple checks with the time at
// which they were performed, so that timestamp must be used for later
// operations). The current arrangement is not perfect, and some
// opportunities for improvement appear, but any changes must be made
// very carefully.
//
// NOTE(bdarnell): The biggest problem with the current code is that
// with epoch-based leases, we may do two separate slow operations
// (IncrementEpoch/Heartbeat and RequestLease/AdminTransferLease). In
// the organization that was inherited from expiration-based leases,
// we prepare the arguments we're going to use for the lease
// operations before performing the liveness operations, and by the
// time the liveness operations complete those may be stale.
//
// Therefore, my suggested refactoring would be to move the liveness
// operations earlier in the process, soon after the initial
// leaseStatus call. If a liveness operation is required, do it and
// start over, with a fresh leaseStatus.
//
// This could also allow the liveness operations to be coalesced per
// node instead of having each range separately queue up redundant
// liveness operations. (The InitOrJoin model predates the
// singleflight package; could we simplify things by using it?)

						// some point be asked to propose the replica change's EndTransaction to
						// Raft. A check has been added that prevents proposals that amount to the
						// removal of the proposer's (and hence lease holder's) Replica, preventing
						// this scenario.
						//
						// 2. A lease is accepted for a Replica that has been removed. Without
						// precautions, this could happen because lease requests are special in
						// that they are the only command that is proposed on a follower (other
						// commands may be proposed from followers, but not successfully so). For
						// all proposals, processRaftCommand checks that their ProposalLease is
						// compatible with the active lease for the log position. For commands
						// proposed on the lease holder, the spanlatch manager then serializes
						// everything. But lease requests get created on followers based on their
						// local state and thus without being sequenced through latching. Thus
						// a recently removed follower (unaware of its own removal) could submit
						// a proposal for the lease (correctly using as a ProposerLease the last
						// active lease), and would receive it given the up-to-date ProposerLease.
						// Hence, an extra check is in order: processRaftCommand makes sure that
						// lease requests for a replica not in the descriptor are bounced.
