	// quiescent ranges on the origin store have unquiesced and updates it
	// storeClosedTSMap accordingly.
	//
	// TODO(tschottdorf): this could just be an int64 (i.e. not
	// tracked per store), but this also serves a more subtle use case:
	// Assume a peer store has only quiesced ranges; it wouldn't receive
	// any update from this node proactively. We need to somehow keep
	// track of the fact that that peer still needs to receive a store
	// closed timestamp regularly. This map is used for that purpose
	// by making sure that we send to every store within in each round
	// of updates, even if all we're sharing is the closed timestamp.
	// This approach comes with the problem that when a store disappears,
	// we'll try sending to it "forever". There needs to be some expiration;
	// we should probably just send to all live stores instead. Left as a
	// separate PR.
