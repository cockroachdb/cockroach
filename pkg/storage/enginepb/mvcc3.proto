  //
  // Writes within the txn are performed using the most up-to-date value of this
  // timestamp that is available. For example, suppose a txn starts at some
  // timestamp, writes a key/value, and has its timestamp forwarded while doing
  // so because a later version already exists at that key. As soon as the txn
  // coordinator learns of the updated timestamp, it will begin performing
  // writes at the updated timestamp. The coordinator may, however, continue
  // issuing writes at the original timestamp before it learns about the
  // forwarded timestamp. The process of resolving the intents when the txn
  // commits will bump any intents written at an older timestamp to the final
  // commit timestamp.
  //
  // Note that reads do not occur at this timestamp; they instead occur at
  // ReadTimestamp, which is tracked in the containing roachpb.Transaction.
  //
  // Writes used to be performed at the txn's read timestamp before 57d02014.
  // However, there are now several important reasons to perform writes at the
  // write timestamp instead of the txn's read timestamp:
  //
  //    1. This timestamp is forwarded by the timestamp cache when this
  //       transaction attempts to write beneath a more recent read. Leaving the
  //       intent at the original timestamp would write beneath that read, which
  //       would violate an invariant that time-bound iterators rely on.
  //
  //       For example, consider a client that uses a time-bound iterator to
  //       poll for changes to a key. The client reads (ts5, ts10], sees no
  //       writes, and reports that no changes have occurred up to t10. Then a
  //       txn writes an intent at its original timestamp ts7. The txn's
  //       timestamp is forwarded to ts11 by the timestamp cache thanks to the
  //       client's read. Meanwhile, the client reads (ts10, ts15] and, again
  //       seeing no intents, reports that no changes have occurred to the key
  //       up to t15. Now the txn commits at ts11 and bumps the intent to ts11.
  //       But the client thinks it has seen all changes up to t15, and so never
  //       sees the intent! We avoid this problem by writing intents at the
  //       provisional commit timestamp instead. In this example, the intent
  //       would instead be written at ts11 and picked up by the client's next
  //       read from (ts10, ts15].
  //
  //    2. Unnecessary PushTxn roundtrips are avoided. If a transaction is
  //       forwarded from ts5 to ts10, the rest of its intents will be written
  //       at ts10. Reads at t < ts10 that encounter these intents can ignore
  //       them; if the intents had instead been left at ts5, these reads would
  //       have needed to send PushTxn requests just to find out that the txn
  //       had, in fact, been forwarded to a non-conflicting time.
  //
  //    3. Unnecessary intent rewriting is avoided. Writing at the original
  //       timestamp when this timestamp has been forwarded guarantees that the
  //       value will need to be rewritten at the forwarded timestamp if the
  //       transaction commits.

  //
  // The timestamp is currently used in three places:

  //    determining whether this transaction's record can be initially
  //    written. The timestamp is compared against the transaction's
  //    corresponding timestamp cache entry to ensure that a
  //    finalized transaction can never commit, either after a replay
  //    or a transaction abort. See CanCreateTxnRecord.
  // 2. by intent resolution to efficiently scan for intents while
  //    using a time-bound iterator - i.e. there can be intents to
  //    resolve up to the timestamp that the txn started with.
  // 3. by would-be pushers, when they run into an intent but the corresponding
  //    txn record was not yet written. In that case, the pusher uses this field
