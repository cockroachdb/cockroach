// MVCCStats tracks byte and instance counts for various groups of keys,

//
// It also tracks two cumulative ages, namely that of intents and non-live
// (i.e. GC-able) bytes. This computation is intrinsically linked to
// last_update_nanos and is easy to get wrong. Updates happen only once every
// full second, as measured by last_update_nanos/1e9. That is, forward updates
// don't change last_update_nanos until an update at a timestamp which,
// truncated to the second, is ahead of last_update_nanos/1e9. Then, that
// difference in seconds times the base quantity (excluding the currently
// running update) is added to the age.
//
// To give an example, if an intent is around from `t=2.5s` to `t=4.1s` (the
// current time), then it contributes an intent age of two seconds (one second
// picked up when crossing `t=3s`, another one at `t=4s`). Similarly, if a
// GC'able kv pair is around for this amount of time, it contributes two seconds
// times its size in bytes.
//
// It gets more complicated when data is
// accounted for with a timestamp behind last_update_nanos. In this case, if
// more than a second has passed (computed via truncation above), the ages have
// to be adjusted to account for this late addition. This isn't hard: add the
// new data's base quantity times the (truncated) number of seconds behind.
// Important to keep in mind with those computations is that (x/1e9 - y/1e9)
// does not equal (x-y)/1e9 in most cases.
//
// Note that this struct must be kept at a fixed size by using fixed-size
// encodings for all fields and by making all fields non-nullable. This is
// so that it can predict its own impact on the size of the system-local
// kv-pairs.
