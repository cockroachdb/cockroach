	//
	// Since this is all handled in handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked, we're assured
	// that even though we may sync new entries to disk after sending them in
	// MsgApps to followers, we'll always have them synced to disk before we
	// process followers' MsgAppResps for the corresponding entries because this
	// entire method requires RaftMu to be locked. This is a requirement because
	// etcd/raft does not support commit quorums that do not include the leader,
	// even though the Raft thesis states that this would technically be safe:
	// > The leader may even commit an entry before it has been written to its
	// > own disk, if a majority of followers have written it to their disks;
	// > this is still safe.
	//
	// However, MsgApps are also used to inform followers of committed entries
	// through the Commit index that they contains. Because the optimization
	// sends all MsgApps before syncing to disc, we may send out a commit index
	// in a MsgApp that we have not ourselves written in HardState.Commit. This
	// is ok, because the Commit index can be treated as volatile state, as is
	// supported by raft.MustSync. The Raft thesis corroborates this, stating in
	// section: `3.8 Persisted state and server restarts` that:
	// > Other state variables are safe to lose on a restart, as they can all be
	// > recreated. The most interesting example is the commit index, which can

// the client waiting for it (if it's waiting on this Replica).

// to decide whether the proposal should be applied: the command's MaxLeaseIndex
// must move the state machine's LeaseAppliedIndex forward, and the proposer's
// lease (or rather its sequence number) must match that of the state machine.
// Furthermore, the GCThreshold is validated and it is checked whether the
// request's key span is contained in the Replica's (it is unclear whether all
// of these checks are necessary). If any of the checks fail, the proposal's
// content is wiped and we apply an empty log entry instead, returning an error

// an update of the Replica's in-memory state to match updates to the on-disk
// state, or pass intents to the intent resolver. Some commands don't fit this
// simple schema and need to hook deeper into the code. Notably splits and merges
