// 5. read(k) on leaseholder n2 at OrigTimestamp=0.98 should get
//    ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval because of the write in step 1, so
//    even though we observed n2's timestamp in step 3 we must expand
//    the uncertainty interval to the lease's start time, which is
//    guaranteed to be greater than any write which occurred under
