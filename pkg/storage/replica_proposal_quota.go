		// route to a given follower at any point in time.

		// In state ProgressStateProbe, the Match index equals Next-1, and
		// it tells us the leader's optimistic best guess for the right log
		// index (and will try once per heartbeat interval to update its
		// estimate). In the usual case, the follower responds with a hint
		// when it rejects the first probe and the leader replicates or
		// sends a snapshot. In the case in which the follower does not
		// respond, the leader reduces Match by one each heartbeat interval.
		// But if the follower does not respond, we've already filtered it
		// out above. We use the Match index as is, even though the follower
		// likely isn't there yet because that index won't go up unless the
		// follower is actually catching up, so it won't cause it to fall
		// behind arbitrarily.

		// Another interesting tidbit about this state is that the Paused
		// field is usually true as it is used to limit the number of probes
		// (i.e. appends) sent to this follower to one per heartbeat
		// interval.
		//
		// In state ProgressStateSnapshot, the Match index is the last known
		// (possibly optimistic, depending on previous state) index before
		// the snapshot went out. Once the snapshot applies, the follower
		// will enter ProgressStateReplicate again. So here the Match index
		// works as advertised too.
