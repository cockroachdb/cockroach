// executeWriteBatch is the entry point for client requests which may mutate the
// range's replicated state. Requests taking this path are evaluated and ultimately
// serialized through Raft, but pass through additional machinery whose goal is
// to allow commands which commute to be proposed in parallel. The naive
// alternative, submitting requests to Raft one after another, paying massive
// latency, is only taken for commands whose effects may overlap.
//
// Concretely,
//
// - Latches for the keys affected by the command are acquired (i.e.
//   tracked as in-flight mutations).
// - In doing so, we wait until no overlapping mutations are in flight.
// - The timestamp cache is checked to determine if the command's affected keys
//   were accessed with a timestamp exceeding that of the command; if so, the
//   command's timestamp is incremented accordingly.
// - A RaftCommand is constructed. If proposer-evaluated KV is active,
//   the request is evaluated and the Result is placed in the
//   RaftCommand. If not, the request itself is added to the command.
// - The proposal is inserted into the Replica's in-flight proposals map,
//   a lease index is assigned to it, and it is submitted to Raft, returning
//   a channel.
// - The result of the Raft proposal is read from the channel and the command
//   registered with the timestamp cache, its latches are released, and
//   its result (which could be an error) is returned to the client.
//
// Returns exactly one of a response, an error or re-evaluation reason.
//
// NB: changing BatchRequest to a pointer here would have to be done cautiously
// as this method makes the assumption that it operates on a shallow copy (see
// call to applyTimestampCache).
