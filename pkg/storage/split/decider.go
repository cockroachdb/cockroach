// A Decider collects measurements about the activity (measured in qps) on a
// Replica and, assuming that qps thresholds are exceeded, tries to determine
// a split key that would approximately result in halving the load on each of
// the resultant ranges.
//
// Operations should call `Record` with a current timestamp. Operation counts
// are aggregated over a second and a qps computed. If the QPS is above threshold,
// a split finder is instantiated and the spans supplied to Record are sampled
// for a duration (on the order of ten seconds). Assuming that load consistently
// remains over threshold, and the workload touches a diverse enough set of keys
// to benefit from a split, sampling will eventually instruct a caller of Record
// to carry out a split. When the split is initiated, it can obtain the suggested
// split point from MaybeSplitKey (which may have disappeared either due to a drop
// in qps or a change in the workload).
