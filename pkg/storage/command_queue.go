// A CommandQueue maintains an interval tree of keys or key ranges for
// executing commands. New commands affecting keys or key ranges must
// wait on already-executing commands which overlap their key range.
//
// Before executing, a command invokes getPrereqs() to acquire a slice of
// references to overlapping commands that are already in the command queue.
// After determining its prerequisite commands, the command is added to the
// queue via add(). getPrereqs() and add() accept a parameter indicating whether
// the command is read-only. Read-only commands don't need to wait on other
// read-only commands, so the commands returned via getPrereqs() don't include
// read-only on read-only overlapping commands as an optimization. Both getPrereqs()
// and add() must see an atomic view of the command queue, so in a concurrent setting,
// their execution must be synchronized under the same lock.
//
// After determining prerequisite commands and adding the new command to the
// command queue, the new command must wait on each prerequisite command's
// pending channel for confirmation that all overlapping commands have completed
// and that the new command can proceed.
//
// Once commands complete, remove() is invoked to remove the executing
// command and close its channel, possibly signaling waiting commands
// who were gated by the executing command's affected key(s).

	// Removing the prereq from our own list is important so that it is not
	// transferred to our dependents when we finish pending (either from
	// completion or cancellation).
	//
	// If the prerequisite command was canceled, we have to handle the
	// cancellation here. We do this by migrating transitive dependencies from
	// canceled prerequisite to the current command. All prerequisites of the
	// prerequisite that was just canceled that were still pending at the time
	// of cancellation are now this command's direct prerequisites. The append
	// does not need to be synchronized, because prereq.prereqs will only ever
	// be mutated on the other side of the prereq.pending closing, which the Go
	// Memory Model promises is safe.
	//
	// While it may be possible that some of these transitive dependencies no
	// longer overlap the current command, they are still required, because they
	// themselves might be dependent on a command that overlaps both the current
	// and prerequisite command.
	//
	// For instance, take the following dependency graph, where command 3 was
	// canceled. We need to set command 2 as a prerequisite of command 4 even
	// though they do not overlap because command 2 has a dependency on command
	// 1, which does overlap command 4. We could try to catch this situation and
	// set command 1 as a prerequisite of command 4 directly, but this approach
	// would require much more complexity and would need to traverse all the way
	// up the dependency graph in the worst case.

	//  cmd 3:     xxxxxxxxxxx
	//              |
	//  cmd 4:   -----
	//
	// It is also be possible that some of the transitive dependencies are
	// unnecessary and that we're being pessimistic here. An example case for
	// this is shown in the following dependency graph, where a write separating
	// two reads is canceled. During the cancellation, command 3 will take
	// command 1 as it's prerequisite even though reads do not need to wait on
	// other reads. We could be smarter here and detect these cases, but the
	// pessimism does not affect correctness.

		// overlapping keys. This comes as an alternative to returning explicit prerequisite
		// dependencies to all gating commands for each new command, which could result
		// in an exponential dependency explosion.
		//
		// For example, consider the following 5 write commands, each with key ranges

		//
		// cmd 1:   --------------
		//           |      |
		// cmd 2:    |  -------------

		// cmd 5:         -------
		//
		// Instead of having each command establish explicit dependencies on all previous
		// overlapping commands, each command only needs to establish explicit dependencies
		// on the set of overlapping commands closest to the new command that together span
		// the new command's key range. Following this strategy, the other dependencies
		// will be implicitly enforced, which reduces memory utilization and synchronization
		// costs.
		//
		// This approach is improved further by noting that dependencies on overlapping
		// commands (even those that cover additional portions of the new command) that are
		// transitive dependencies of commands that we have already established a dependency
		// on can be safely ignored. This is safe because dependencies will be transitively
		// enforced. Following this strategy, all command dependencies will be enforced
		// without the need for the majority of dependencies to be held explicitly, which
		// reduces memory utilization and synchronization costs. All together, the final
		// dependency graph will look something like:
		//
		// cmd 1:   --------------
		//                  |
		// cmd 2:       -------------
		//                |
		// cmd 3:    -------
		//                |
		// cmd 4:         -------
		//                   |
		// cmd 5:         -------
		//
		// The exception are existing reads: since reads don't wait for each other, an incoming
		// write must wait for reads even when they are covered by a "later" read (since that
		// "later" read won't wait for the earlier read to complete). However, if that read is
		// covered by a "later" write, we don't need to wait because writes can't be reordered.
		//
		// Two examples of how this logic works are shown below. Notice in the first example how
		// the overlapping reads do not establish dependencies on each other, and can therefore
		// be reordered. Also notice in the second example that once read command 4 overlaps
		// a "later" write, it no longer needs to be a dependency for the new write command 5.
		// However, because read command 3 does not overlap a "later" write, it is still a
		// dependency for the new write, but can be safely reordered before or after command 4.

		// Things get more interesting with timestamps:
		// -------------------------------------------
		// - For a read-only command, overlaps will include only writes which have occurred
		//   with earlier timestamps. Because writes all must depend on each other, things
		//   work as expected.
		//
		// - Write commands overlap both reads and writes. The writes that a write command
		//   overlaps will depend reliably on each other if they in turn overlap. However, reads
		//   that a write command overlaps may not in turn be depended on by overlapping writes,
		//   if the reads have earlier timestamps. This means that writes don't necessarily
		//   subsume overlapping reads.
		//
		//   We solve this problem by always including read commands with timestamps less than
		//   the latest write timestamp seen so far, which guarantees that we will wait on any
		//   reads which might not be dependend on by writes with higher IDs. Similarly, we
		//   include write commands with timestamps greater than or equal to the earliest
		//   read timestamp seen so far.
