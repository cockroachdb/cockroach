// SingleStorage stores and manages closed timestamp updates originating from a
// single source (i.e. node). A SingleStorage internally maintains multiple
// buckets for historical closed timestamp information. The reason for this is
// twofold:
//
// 1. The most recent closed timestamp update is also the hardest to prove a
// read for, since it comes with larger minimum lease applied indexes. In
// situations in which followers are lagging behind with their command
// application, this could lead to a runaway scenario, in which a closed
// timestamp update can never be used until it is replaced by a new one, which
// in turn also will never be used, etc. Instead, a SingleStorage keeps some
// amount of history and upstream systems can try to prove a follower read using
// an older closed timestamp instead.
//
// 2. Follower reads can be used to implement recovery of a consistent
// cluster-wide snapshot after catastrophic loss of quorum. To do this, the
// mechanism must locate at least one replica of every range in the cluster, and
// for each range find the largest possible timestamp at which follower reads
// are possible among the surviving replicas. Of all these per-range timestamps,
// the smallest can be used to read from all ranges, resulting in a consistent
// snapshot. This makes it crucial that every replica can serve at least some
// follower reads, even when regularly outpaced by the closed timestamp
// frontier. Emitted MLAIs may never even be proposed to Raft in the event of
// an ill-timed crash, and so historic information is invaluable.
//
