  // the request timestamp are used to verify an expiration-based lease.
  //
  // To see why lease verification downstream of Raft is required, consider the
  // following example:
  // - replica 1 receives a client request for a write
  // - replica 1 checks the lease; the write is permitted
  // - replica 1 proposes the command
  // - time passes, replica 2 commits a new lease

  // - the command applies on replica 2

  // counter has already reached (or exceeded) max_lease_index.

  // The lease index is a reorder protection mechanism - we don't want Raft
  // commands (proposed by a single node, the one with proposer_lease) executing
  // in a different order than the one in which the corresponding KV requests
  // were evaluated and the commands were proposed. This is important because
  // the CommandQueue does not fully serialize commands - mostly when it comes
  // to updates to the internal state of the range (this should be re-evaluated
  // once proposer-evaluated KV is completed - see #10413).
  // Similar to the Raft applied index, it is strictly increasing, but may have
  // gaps. A command will only apply successfully if its max_lease_index has not
  // been surpassed by the Range's applied lease index (in which case the
  // command may need to be retried, that is, regenerated with a higher
  // max_lease_index). When the command applies, the new lease index will
  // increase to max_lease_index (so a potential later replay will fail).
  //
  // This mechanism was introduced as a simpler alternative to using the Raft
  // applied index, which is fraught with complexity due to the need to predict
  // exactly the log position at which a command will apply, even when the Raft
  // leader is not colocated with the lease holder (which usually proposes all
  // commands).
  //
  // Pinning the lease-index to the assigned slot (as opposed to allowing gaps
  // as we do now) is an interesting venue to explore from the standpoint of
  // parallelization: One could hope to enforce command ordering in that way
  // (without recourse to a higher-level locking primitive such as the command
  // queue). This is a hard problem: First of all, managing the pending
  // commands gets more involved; a command must not be removed if others have
  // been added after it, and on removal, the assignment counters must be
  // updated accordingly. Managing retry of proposals becomes trickier as
  // well as that uproots whatever ordering was originally envisioned.
