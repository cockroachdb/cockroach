  //
  // The lease index is a replay protection mechanism. Similar to the Raft
  // applied index, it is strictly increasing, but may have gaps. A command
  // will only apply successfully if its max_lease_index has not been surpassed
  // by the Range's applied lease index (in which case the command may need
  // to be retried, that is, regenerated with a higher max_lease_index).
  // When the command applies, the new lease index will increase to
  // max_lease_index (so a potential later replay will fail).
  //
  // This mechanism was introduced as a simpler alternative to using the Raft
  // applied index, which is fraught with complexity due to the need to predict
  // exactly the log position at which a command will apply, even when the Raft
  // leader is not colocated with the lease holder (which usually proposes all
  // commands).
  //
  // Pinning the lease-index to the assigned slot (as opposed to allowing gaps
  // as we do now) is an interesting venue to explore from the standpoint of
  // parallelization: One could hope to enforce command ordering in that way
  // (without recourse to a higher-level locking primitive such as the command
  // queue). This is a hard problem: First of all, managing the pending
  // commands gets more involved; a command must not be removed if others have
  // been added after it, and on removal, the assignment counters must be
  // updated accordingly. Managing retry of proposals becomes trickier as
