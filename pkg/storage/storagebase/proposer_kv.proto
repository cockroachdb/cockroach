  // the CommandQueue does not fully serialize commands - mostly when it comes
  // to updates to the internal state of the range (this should be re-evaluated
  // once proposer-evaluated KV is completed - see #10413).
  // Similar to the Raft applied index, it is strictly increasing, but may have
  // gaps. A command will only apply successfully if its max_lease_index has not
  // been surpassed by the Range's applied lease index (in which case the

  // max_lease_index). When the command applies, the new lease index will

  // applied index, which is fraught with complexity due to the need to predict
  // exactly the log position at which a command will apply, even when the Raft
  // leader is not colocated with the lease holder (which usually proposes all
  // commands).
  //
  // Pinning the lease-index to the assigned slot (as opposed to allowing gaps
  // as we do now) is an interesting venue to explore from the standpoint of
  // parallelization: One could hope to enforce command ordering in that way
  // (without recourse to a higher-level locking primitive such as the command
  // queue). This is a hard problem: First of all, managing the pending
  // commands gets more involved; a command must not be removed if others have
