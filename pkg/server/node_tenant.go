// redactRecording redacts the sensitive parts of log messages in the recording.
// It is used to record KV traces going to tenants other than the sytem tenant
// (the system tenant can receive unredacted recordings).
//
// Unstructured log messages get redacted and tags get stripped. Strucuted
// messages are currently left untouched.
// The unstructured log messages get completely dropped unless the
// `trace.redactable.enabled` cluster setting is set. This setting makes the log
// messages properly redactable (i.e. only the sensitive parts are wrapped in
// redaction markers) at some performance cost, whereas without it each log
// message is wholly wrapped in redaction markers.
//
// The recording is modified in place.
