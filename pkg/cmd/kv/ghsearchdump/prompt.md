# Milestone Summary Prompt

Use this prompt with an LLM to generate a monthly progress summary from the JSON output of `ghsearchdump`.

---

You are helping write a monthly progress summary for a software engineering team.

I have JSON containing PRs worked on this month (attached). Please help me create a ~400 word narrative summary suitable for inclusion in a larger milestone document.

Requirements:
- Write in narrative prose, not bullet lists (e.g., "Wenyi went deep on X and fixed Y")
- Attribute work to authors by first name (map: wenyihu6=Wenyi, tbg=Tobias, sumeerbhola=Sumeer, angeladietz=Angela)
- Use inline markdown links for Jira compatibility: `[#12345](https://github.com/...)`
- Group PRs thematically behind descriptions, not one link per PR
- Extract Epic IDs using `/Epic[:\s]+CRDB-(\d+)/i` to identify major workstreams
- Focus on outcomes and themes, not individual PR details
- Skip bot comments, CI noise, and mechanical changes

Tone: Technical but readable for engineering leadership. Emphasize what was accomplished and why it matters.

## Tips

- Attach the JSON file generated by `ghsearchdump` to your prompt
- You may need to iterate: ask for condensing, different formatting, or additional links
- Consider a two-phase approach: first get a thematic analysis, then write your own narrative and ask the LLM to "add relevant PR links"
