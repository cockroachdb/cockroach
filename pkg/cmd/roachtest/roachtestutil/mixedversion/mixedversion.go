// Package mixedversion implements a framework for testing
// functionality when a cluster is in a mixed-version state.
//
// Mixed-version is defined as points in time when some (potentially
// not all) nodes have been upgraded to a certain binary version, or
// the state when all nodes have been upgraded, but the cluster itself
// is in the process of upgrading to that version (i.e., running
// migrations). This also applies to clusters that have upgraded
// binaries on all nodes and then later decided to downgrade to a
// previous version (which is permitted if the `preserve_downgrade_option`
// cluster setting is set accordingly).
//
// The goal of the framework is to let test writers focus on the
// functionality they want to test in a mixed-version state, rather
// than having to worry about how to set that up, stopping and
// restarting nodes, etc.
//
// In the most common use-case, callers will just call the
// `InMixedVersion` function on the test object defining what they
// want to test in a mixed-version state. The framework will take care
// of exercising that functionality in different mixed-version states,
// randomizing the order of events in each run. A detailed test plan
// is logged *before* the test runs; it facilitates debugging a test
// failure by summarizing all executed steps.
//
// Typical usage:
//
//			mvt, err := mixedversion.NewTest(...)
//			mvt.InMixedVersion("test my feature", func(
//		  ctx context.Context, l *logger.Logger, rng *rand.Rand, h *mixedversion.Helper,
//		 ) error {
//			    l.Printf("testing feature X")
//			    node, db := h.RandomDB(rng, c.All())
//			    l.Printf("running query on node %d", node)
//			    _, err := db.ExecContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM test")
//			    return err
//			})
//			mvt.InMixedVersion("test another feature", func(
//	     ctx context.Context, l *logger.Logger, rng *rand.Rand, h *mixedversion.Helper,
//	   ) error {
//			    l.Printf("testing feature Y")
//			    node, db := h.RandomDB(rng, c.All())
//			    l.Printf("running query on node %d", node)
//			    _, err := db.ExecContext(ctx, "SELECT * FROM test2")
//			    return err
//			})
//			mvt.Run()
//
// Functions passed to `InMixedVersion` will be called at arbitrary
// points during an upgrade/downgrade process. They may also be called
// sequentially or concurrently. This information will be included in
// the test plan. Any messages logged during the execution of the hook
// should use the Logger instance passed as a parameter to it. This
// logger writes to a `mixed-version-test/{ID}.log` file, allowing
// easy cross referencing between a test step and its corresponding
// output.
//
// The random seed used to generate a test plan is logged; reusing the
// same seed will lead to the exact same test plan being generated. To
// set a specific seed when running a mixed-version test, one can set
// the `COCKROACH_RANDOM_SEED` environment variable.

// 2. maxUpgrades must be >= minUpgrades.
// 3. minimumSupportedVersion must be from an older release series than the current version. (This ensures that at least one upgrade is possible.)
// 4. At least one valid deployment mode must be enabled.
// 5. If SeparateProcessDeployment is enabled, the cluster must have at least 3 nodes.
// 6. If minimumBootstrapVersion is set, it must be from an older release series than the current version.
// 7. If minimumBootstrapVersion is set, it must allow for at least minUpgrades to the current version.
