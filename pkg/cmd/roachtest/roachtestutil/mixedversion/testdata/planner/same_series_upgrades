# Test that we are able to generate test plans with same-series upgrades
# (patch-level upgrades within the same major.minor release series).
#
# Same-series upgrades test upgrading between patch releases, e.g.,
# v24.1.2 -> v24.1.5, which is a common customer scenario that we want
# to ensure works correctly.

# With same_series_upgrade_probability=1.0, the framework will insert
# older patch versions before each version in the upgrade path when possible.
# We set min_upgrades=1 (base) and max_upgrades=4 (to allow room for same-series
# insertions). The resulting path shows a same-series upgrade: 24.2.0 -> 24.2.1.
