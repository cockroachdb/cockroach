# Test that we are able to generate test plans with same-series upgrades
# (patch-level upgrades within the same major.minor release series).
#
# Same-series upgrades test upgrading between patch releases, e.g.,
# v24.1.2 -> v24.1.5, which is a common customer scenario that we want
# to ensure works correctly.

# With same_series_upgrade_probability=1.0, numUpgrades() picks majorUpgrades
# from [1, max_upgrades] and sameSeriesUpgrades from [0, max_upgrades - major].
# With max_upgrades=3, this allows up to 2 same-series insertions alongside the
# cross-series upgrades, bounded by the total max_upgrades.
