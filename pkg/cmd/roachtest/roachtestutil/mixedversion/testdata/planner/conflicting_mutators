# Tests that we are able to deal with mutators that insert relative to
# steps that are later removed by subsequent mutations. The initial
# insertion should create a concurrent step with user-hooks (see
# `mutator_probabilities` test) and the second mutator removes user
# hooks, flattening that concurrent run.
