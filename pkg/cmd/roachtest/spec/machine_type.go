// SelectAWSMachineType selects a machine type given the desired number of CPUs,
// memory per CPU, support for locally-attached SSDs and CPU architecture. It
// returns a compatible machine type and its architecture.
//
// When MemPerCPU is Standard, the memory per CPU ratio is 4 GB. For High, it is 8 GB.
// For Auto, it's 4 GB up to and including 16 CPUs, then 2 GB. Low is not supported.
//
// N.B. in some cases, the selected architecture and machine type may be _different_ from the requested one. E.g.,
// graviton3 with >= 24xlarge (96 vCPUs) isn't available, so we fall back to (c|m|r)6i.24xlarge.
// To keep parity with GCE, we fall back to AMD Milan (c6a.24xlarge) if cpus > 80. However, this family doesn't support
// local SSDs.
//
// N.B. cpus is expected to be an even number; validation is deferred to a specific cloud provider.

// N.B. if mem is Auto, and cpus > 80, we fall back to AMD Milan (c6a.24xlarge).
//
// At the time of writing, the intel machines are all third-generation Xeon, "Ice Lake" which are isomorphic to
// GCE's n2-(standard|highmem|custom) _with_ --minimum-cpu-platform="Intel Ice Lake" (roachprod's default).
