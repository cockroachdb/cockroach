	// is necessary after every release. For example, the day `master` becomes
	// the 20.2 release, this test will fail because it is missing a fixture for
	// 20.1; run the test (on 20.1). Check it in (instructions will be logged
	// below) and off we go.
	//
	// The version to create/update the fixture for must be released
	// (i.e.  can download it from the homepage). For example, to make a
	// "v20.2" fixture, you will need a binary that has "v20.2" in the
	// output of `./cockroach version`, and this process will end up
	// creating fixtures that have "v20.2" in them. This would be part
	// of tagging the master branch as v21.1 in the process of going
	// through the major release for v20.2. The version is passed in as
	// FIXTURE_VERSION environment variable. The contents of this
	// environment variable must match a released cockroach binary.
	//
	// Please note that you do *NOT* need to update the fixtures in a patch
	// release. This only happens as part of preparing the master branch for the
	// next release. The release team runbooks, at time of writing, reflect
	// this.
	//
	// Example invocation:
	//   FIXTURE_VERSION=v20.2.0-beta.1 roachtest --local run generate-fixtures \
	//     --debug --cockroach ./cockroach --suite fixtures
