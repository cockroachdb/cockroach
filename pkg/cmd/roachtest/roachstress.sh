Build and stress run roachtest
Usage:
  $(basename "${0}") [flags] <test name> [-- <roachtest flags>]

flags:
  -c COUNT - number of test iterations to run
  -l       - run test locally on host
  -u       - build cockroach with ui (don't use buildshort)
  -b       - do not rebuild binaries if they exist

Roachstress will build artifacts inside artifacts/<commit-hash> directory
for later reuse. This is eliminating the need to rebuild when comparing
branches.
If roachstress detects that there's an uncommitted change, it would always
try to rebuild into artifacts/<commit-hash>-dirty to allow temporary test
or cockroach changes for reproductions.
Local change rebuilding behavior could be disabled by -b flag.
