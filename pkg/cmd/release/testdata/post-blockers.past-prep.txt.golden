Hello!

There remains open release blockers against the v21.1.13 release: https://go.crdb.dev/blockers/21.2.

The previous release date of Feb 15, 2022 has now been cancelled, as we have passed the default duration needed to qualify the release candidate.

The new release date for v21.1.13 is now Mar 3, 2022. An extraordinary request would be required to publish a 21.1 release sooner than Mar 3, 2022.

Thanks,
Release Engineering
