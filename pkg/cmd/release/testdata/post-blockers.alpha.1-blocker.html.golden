    </p>
    
    
      <p>
        <strong>Respective teams: please review blockers below</strong> to assess if any of these cause
        known data loss or corruption[1]. Otherwise, we will proceed to prep & qualify on Tuesday
        <strong>even if there are open release blockers</strong>.
      </p>
      
      
        <p>
          There is currently <strong>1 open release blocker</strong>
          (<a href='https://go.crdb.dev/blockers'>go.crdb.dev/blockers</a>):

        [1] As per our <a href='https://cockroachlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/869990521/Release+Process+Terms+and+Definitions'
        >terms & definitions</a>, alphas/betas <strong>should not cause data loss or corruption</strong>,
        but may contain both known and unknown issues including speed or performance issues. As with other alphas:
        <ul>
          <li>there would be no expectation that it would be used in prod or needs to be supported</li>
          <li>alpha clusters must be wiped, and cannot be upgraded to 22.1 betas, RCs or final production release</li>
          <li>alphas/betas may contain both known and unknown issues including speed or performance issues</li>
        </ul>
