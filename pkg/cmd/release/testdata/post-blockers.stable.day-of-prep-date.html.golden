<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
  The <strong>v19.1.11 release date of Monday, April 11 will be cancelled tomorrow</strong>
  if the following release blockers are not resolved before tonight's nightly build.
</p>
  
  
      
      
      <p>
        There are currently <strong>9 open release blockers</strong>
        (<a href='https://go.crdb.dev/blockers'>go.crdb.dev/blockers</a>),
        which must be resolved before a candidate is chosen:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
      
        <li>Project 1: 4</li>
      
        <li>Project 2: 2</li>
      
        <li>Project 3: 3</li>
      
      </ul>

  Thanks,<br />
