Hello!

The v19.1.0-alpha.3 release is scheduled for prep & qualification on Saturday, April 2 for a scheduled release of Monday, April 11.

Respective teams: please review blockers below to assess if any of these cause known data loss or corruption[1]. Otherwise, we will proceed to prep & qualify on Tuesday even if there are open release blockers.

There are currently 9 open release blockers (https://go.crdb.dev/blockers):
  - Project 1: 4
  - Project 2: 2
  - Project 3: 3

[1] As per our terms & definitions, alphas/betas should not cause data loss or corruption, but may contain both known and unknown issues including speed or performance issues. As with other alphas:
  - there would be no expectation that it would be used in prod or needs to be supported
  - alpha clusters must be wiped, and cannot be upgraded to 22.1 betas, RCs or final production release
  - alphas/betas may contain both known and unknown issues including speed or performance issues
