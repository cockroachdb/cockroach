<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
  There remains <strong>open release blockers</strong> against the v21.1.13 release (https://go.crdb.dev/blockers/21.2).
</p>
<p>
  The previous <strong>release date of Feb 15, 2022 has now been cancelled</strong>, as we have passed the default duration needed to qualify the release candidate.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>new release date for v21.1.13 is now Mar 3, 2022</strong>.
  An extraordinary request would be required to publish a 21.1 release sooner than Mar 3, 2022.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks,<br />
  Release Engineering
