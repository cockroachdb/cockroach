Hello!

There remains open release blockers against the {{ .Args.Version }} release: https://go.crdb.dev/blockers/21.2.

The previous release date of {{ .Args.ReleaseDate }} has now been cancelled, as we have passed the default duration needed to qualify the release candidate.

The new release date for {{ .Args.Version }} is now {{ .Args.NextReleaseDate }}. An extraordinary request would be required to publish a {{ .Args.ReleaseSeries }} release sooner than {{ .Args.NextReleaseDate }}.

Thanks,
Release Engineering
