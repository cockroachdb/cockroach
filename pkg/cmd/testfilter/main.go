// testfilter is a utility to manipulate JSON streams in [test2json] format.
// Standard input is read and each line starting with `{` and ending with `}`
// parsed (and expected to parse successfully). Lines not matching this pattern
// are classified as output not related to the test and, depending on the args
// passed to `testfilter`, are passed through or removed. The arguments available
// are `--mode=(strip|omit|convert)`, where:
//
// strip: omit output for non-failing tests, pass everything else through. In
//
//	particular, non-test output and tests that never terminate are passed through.
//
// omit: print only failing tests. Note that test2json does not close scopes for
//
//	tests that are running in parallel (in the same package) with a "foreground"
//	test that panics, so it will pass through *only* the one foreground test.
//	Note also that package scopes are omitted; test2json does not reliably close
//	them on panic/Exit anyway.
//
// convert:
//
//	no filtering is performed, but any test2json input is translated back into
//	its pure Go test framework text representation. This is useful for output
//	intended for human eyes.
//
