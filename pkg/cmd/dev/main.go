Dev is the general-purpose dev tool for folks working cockroachdb/cockroach. It
lets engineers do a few things:

- build various binaries (cockroach, optgen, ...)
- run arbitrary tests (unit tests, logic tests, ...)
- run tests under arbitrary configurations (under stress, using race builds, ...)
- generate code (bazel files, protobufs, ...)

...and much more.

(PS: Almost none of the above is implemented yet, haha.)
