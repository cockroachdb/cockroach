// Package startup provides functionality for retrying kv operations on server
// startup.
//
// Server startup is now heavily dependent on kv for retrieving various
// metadata. It is possible for operations to fail with ambiguous error in case
// of timeouts. This problem is exacerbated by introduction of circuit breakers.
// Circuit breaker will fail fast if previous access to the replica failed
// and will try to do probing and reset in the background.
// Because of this, startup operations could fail immediately if consensus is
// lost on a range thus preventing node from restarting. If the node itself is
// needed to reestablish range consensus then the node would not be able to
// rejoin the cluster at all after circuit breaker is activated on that range
// unless circuit breaker is reset by restarting all nodes.
//
// To address this problem, all kv operations that are part of the start-up
// sequence  must be retried if they encounter kvpb.ReplicaUnavailableError.
// Those errors could be returned from both kv and sql queries.
//
// This package provides functionality to wrap functions in retry loops as well
// as set of assertions to verify that all operations are doing retries during
// startup.
//
// This behaviour is achieved by checking call stack in kv operations and
// queries in internal sql executor. Latter is needed because we can't assert kv
// operations run by executor in separate go routines.
// Assertions expect call context be tagged with startupRetryKey. If they detect
// that call is on startup path and don't have retry tag, server will crash.
// Provided retry functions tag context that is passed to functions being
// retried.
// If test has a test only code path (e.g. avoid background operations for test)
// it is possible to disable retry check by using WithoutChecks decorator for
// context.
//
// Retry tracking is only done when build is run with util.RaceEnabled.
//
// Separate Begin function should be called at the beginning of the startup
// and returned cleanup function should be called at the end. This ensures that
// startup stack is correctly detected and that test clusters are not
// excessively penalized by assertions when startup is complete.
//
// If your test fails because startup assertion failed, then there's a new code
// path run during server startup which is not correctly wrapped in retry loop
// and it could cause node startup failures. You need to identify what is called
// from Server.PreStart and add retry accordingly.
