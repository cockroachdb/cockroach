// XXX: Add tests for everything.

// We don't want the ability for an admitted a request to be able to run
// indefinitely consuming arbitrary CPU. For long-running (~1s of CPU work per
// request) "elastic" (not latency sensitive) work like backups, this can have
// detrimental effects on foreground latencies – once such work is admitted, it
// can take up available CPU cores until completion, which prevents foreground
// work from running. The pieces here aim to improve this behavior; there are
// two components in play:
//
// - A token bucket that hands out slices of CPU time where the total amount
//   handed out is determined by a 'target utilization' – the max % of CPU it's
//   aiming to use (on a 8vCPU machine, if targeting 50% CPU, it can hand out
//   .50 * 8 = 4 seconds of CPU time per second).
// - A feedback controller that adjusts the CPU % used by the token bucket
//   periodically by measuring scheduling latency[1]. If over the limit (1ms at
//   p99, chosen experimentally), the % is reduced; if under the limit and we're
//   seeing substantial utilization, the % is increased.
//
// Elastic work acquires CPU tokens representing some predetermined slice of CPU
// time, blocking until these tokens become available. We found that 100ms of
// tokens work well enough experimentally. A larger value, say 250ms, would
// translate to less preemption and fewer RPCs. What's important is that it
// isn't "too much", like 2s of CPU time, since that would let a single request
// hog a core potentially for 2s and allow for a large build up of a runnable
// goroutines (serving foreground traffic) on that core, affecting
// scheduling/foreground latencies.
//
// The work preempts itself once the slice is used up (as a form of cooperative
// scheduling). Once preempted, the request returns to the caller with a
// resumption key. This scheme is effective in clamping down on scheduling
// latency that's due an excessive amount of elastic work. We have proof from
// direct trace captures and instrumentation that reducing scheduling latencies
// directly translates to reduced foreground latencies. They're primarily felt
// when straddling goroutines, typically around RPC boundaries (request/response
// handling goroutines); the effects multiplicative for statements that issue
// multiple requests.
//
// The controller uses fixed deltas for adjustments, adjusting down a bit more
// aggressively than adjusting up. This is due to the nature of the work being
// paced — we care more about quickly introducing a ceiling rather than staying
// near it (though experimentally we’re able to stay near it just fine). It
// adjusts upwards only when seeing a reasonably high % of utilization with the
// allotted CPU quota (assuming it’s under the p99 target). The adjustments are
// small to reduce {over,under}shoot and controller instability at the cost of
// being somewhat dampened. We use a smoothed form of the p99 latency captures
// to add stability to the controller input, which consequently affects the
// controller output. We use a relatively low frequency when sampling scheduler
// latencies; since the p99 is computed off of histogram data, we saw a lot more
// jaggedness when taking p99s off of a smaller set of scheduler events (every
// 50ms for ex.) compared to computing p99s over a larger set of scheduler
// events (every 2500ms). This, with the small deltas used for adjustments, can
// make for a dampened response, but assuming a stable-ish foreground CPU load
// against a node, it works fine. The controller output is limited to a
// well-defined range that can be tuned through cluster settings.
//
// [1]: Specifically the time between a goroutine being ready to run and when
//      it's scheduled to do so by the Go scheduler.
