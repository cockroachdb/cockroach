//
// For example, UserLowPri should map to BulkNormalPri (see the hack below),
// NormalPri maps to LockingNormalPri, and UserHighPri maps to
// LockingUserHighPri. Say users are running at these different priorities in
// different parts of the key space, say key-low, key-normal, key-high, then
// even after the mapping, a txn holding locks (or resolving intents) in
// key-low will have lower priority (BulkNormalPri) than the non-adjusted
// priority in key-normal (NormalPri). The same holds true for txn holding
// locks in key-normal, since LockingNormalPri is lower priority than
// UserHighPri.
//
// Adjusting the priority can also be beneficial when all txns have the same
// QoS requirements, but there is lock contention. In tpcc with 3000
// warehouses, it halved the number of lock waiters, and increased the
// transaction throughput by 10+%. In that experiment 40% of the BatchRequests
