// The functionality in this file is geared towards preventing chronic overload
// of disk bandwidth which typically results in severely high latency for all work.
//
// For now, we assume that:
// - There is a provisioned limit on the sum of read and write bandwidth. This
//   limit is allowed to change. This is true for block devices of major cloud
//   providers.
// - Admission control can only shape the rate of admission of writes. Writes
//   also cause reads, since compactions do reads and writes.
//
// There are multiple challenges:
// - We are unable to precisely track the causes of disk read bandwidth, since
//   we do not have observability into what reads missed the OS page cache.
//   That is we don't know how much of the reads were due to incoming reads
//   (that we don't shape) and how much due to compaction read bandwidth.
//
// - We don't shape incoming reads.
//
// - There can be a large lag (1+min) between the shaping of incoming writes,
//   and when it affects actual writes in the system, since compaction backlog
//   can build up in various levels of the LSM store.
//
// - Signals of overload are coarse, since we cannot view all the internal
//   queues that can build up due to resource overload. For instance,
//   different examples of bandwidth saturation exhibit very different
//   latency effects, presumably because the queue buildup is different. So it
//   is non-trivial to approach full utilization without risking high latency.
//
// Due to these challenges, we adopt a goal of simplicity of design, and
// strong abstraction boundaries.
//
// - The disk load is abstracted using an enum, diskLoadLevel. The
//   diskLoadWatcher, that maps load signals to this enum, can be evolved
//   independently.
//
// - The approach uses easy to understand small multiplicative increase and
//   large multiplicative decrease, (unlike what we do for flush and
//   compaction tokens, where we try to more precisely calculate the
//   sustainable rates).
//
// Since we are using a simple approach that is somewhat coarse in its behavior,
// we start by limiting its application to two kinds of writes (the second one
// is future work, and not yet implemented):
//
// - Incoming writes that are deemed "elastic": This can be done by
//   introducing a work-class (in addition to admissionpb.WorkPriority), or by
//   implying a work-class from the priority (e.g. priorities < NormalPri are
//   deemed elastic).
//
// - Optional compactions: We assume that the LSM store is configured with a
//   ceiling on number of regular concurrent compactions, and if it needs more
//   it can request resources for additional (optional) compactions. These
//   latter compactions can be limited by this approach. See
//   https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble/issues/1329 for motivation.
//   TODO(sumeer): this compaction control is not yet done, though how to do
//   it is included in the prototype in
//   https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/82813
//
// Extending this to all incoming writes is future work.
