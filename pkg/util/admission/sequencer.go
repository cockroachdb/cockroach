package admission

import "sync/atomic"

// sequencer issues monotonic sequencing timestamps derived from observed
// CreateTimes. This is a purpose-built data structure for replication admission
// control where we want to assign each AC-queued work below-raft a "sequence
// number" for FIFO ordering within a <tenant,priority>. We ensure timestamps
// are roughly monotonic with respect to log positions of replicated work[1] by
// sequencing work in log position order at the caller[2]. We also want it to
// track actual CreateTimes (similar to an HLC) for the global-FIFO ordering
// reasons explained in [1].
//
// It's not safe for concurrent access.
//
// ----
//
// Aside: Why not do this CreateTime-generation above raft? This is because these
// sequence numbers are encoded as part of the raft proposal[3], and at
// encode-time, we don't actually know what log position the proposal is going
// to end up in. It's hard to explicitly guarantee that a proposal with
// log-position P1 will get encoded before another with log position P2, where
// P1 < P2.
//
// If we tried to "approximate" CreateTimes at proposal-encode-time,
// approximating log position order, it could result in over-admission. This is
// because of how we return flow tokens -- up to some log index[4], and how use
// these sequence numbers in below-raft WorkQueues. If P2 ends up with a lower
// sequence number/CreateTime, it would get admitted first, and when returning
// flow tokens by log position, in specifying up-to-P2, we'll early return P1's
// flow tokens despite it not being admitted. So we'd over-admit at the sender.
// This is all within a <tenant,priority> pair.
