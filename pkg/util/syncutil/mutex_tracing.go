// tracedLock is like l.Lock, but logs a trace event using the provided context

//
// Explanation of logic:
//
// The function begins with a fast-path call to TryLock. Most mutexes are
// uncontended and TryLock amounts to a single atomic CAS. If the CAS succeeds,
// no additional work is needed. If the CAS fails, we move on to the slow-path.
//
// On the slow path, we first check if expensive logging is enabled. If not, we
// simply call Lock without checking the time. We only time the acquisition if
// expensive logging is enabled. If we do time the acquisition and it is slow,
// we log a warning message to the logs/trace.
//
// It could be a reasonable choice to switch the order of the TryLock and
// ExpensiveLogEnabled checks. However, we expect that most mutex acquisitions
// will be uncontended and the TryLock check is cheaper than the expensive log
// check.
