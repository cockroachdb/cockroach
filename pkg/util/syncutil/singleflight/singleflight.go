// DoChan is like Do but returns a Future that will receive the results when

// Close() must be called on the returned Future if the caller does not
// wait for the Future's result.
//
// opts controls details about how the flight is to run.
//
// NOTE: DoChan makes it possible to initiate or join a flight while holding a
// lock without holding it for the duration of the flight. A common usage
// pattern is:
// 1. Check some datastructure to see if it contains the value you're looking
// for.
// 2. If it doesn't, initiate or join a flight to produce it.
//
// Step one is expected to be done while holding a lock. Modifying the
// datastructure in the callback is expected to need to take the same lock. Once
// a caller proceeds to step two, it likely wants to keep the lock until
// DoChan() returned a channel, in order to ensure that a flight is only started
// before any modifications to the datastructure occurred (relative to the state
// observed in step one). Were the lock to be released before calling DoChan(),
// a previous flight might modify the datastructure before our flight began.
//
// In addition to the above, another reason for using DoChan over Do is so that
// the caller can be canceled while not propagating the cancelation to other
// innocent callers that joined the same flight; the caller can listen to its
// cancelation in parallel to the result channel. See DoOpts.InheritCancelation.
