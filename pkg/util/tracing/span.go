// Span is the tracing Span that we use in CockroachDB. Depending on the tracing
// configuration, it can hold anywhere between zero and three destinations for
// trace information:
//
// 1. external OpenTelemetry-compatible trace collector (Jaeger, Zipkin, Lightstep),
// 2. /debug/requests endpoint (net/trace package); mostly useful for local debugging
// 3. CRDB-internal trace span (powers SQL session tracing).
//
// When there is no need to allocate either of these three destinations,
// a "noop span", i.e. an immutable *Span wrapping the *Tracer, may be
// returned, to allow starting additional nontrivial Spans from the return
// value later, when direct access to the tracer may no longer be available.
//
// The CockroachDB-internal Span (crdbSpan) is more complex because
// rather than reporting to some external sink, the caller's "owner"
// must propagate the trace data back across process boundaries towards
// the root of the trace span tree; see WithParent
// and WithRemoteParentFromSpanMeta, respectively.
//
// Additionally, the internal span type also supports turning on, stopping,
// and restarting its data collection (see Span.StartRecording), and this is
// used extensively in SQL session tracing.
//
// Span is a fairly thin wrapper around spanInner, dealing with guarding against
// use-after-Finish and reference counting for pooling and re-allocating.
type Span struct {
	// helper is the allocation helper that this span is part of. Used to release
	// back into a pool on Finish().
	helper *spanAllocHelper

	i spanInner

	// finished is set on Finish(). Used to detect use-after-Finish.
	finished int32 // atomic

	// refCnt counts the references to this span held by other spans. The Span can
	// only be re-allocated when refCnt reaches zero.
	//
	// The reference counting mechanism is used only internally by the tracing
	// infrastructure. Clients using Spans do not track their references because
	// it'd be too burdensome to require all the references to have a clearly
	// defined life cycle, and to be explicitly released when they're no longer in
	// use. For clients, the contract is that a span can be used until Finish().
	//
	// For convenience, the span itself holds a reference to itself until
	// Finish(). This ensures that the reference count will not become zero before
	// Finish().
	//
	// The reference count serves a couple of purposes:
	// 1) Prevent re-allocation of a Span while child spans are still operating on
	// it. In particular, this ensures that races between Finish()ing a parent and
	// a child cannot result in the child operating on a re-allocated parent.
	// Because of the span's lock ordering convention, a child cannot hold its
	// lock while operating on the parent. During Finish(), the child drops its
	// lock and informs the parent that it is Finish()ing. If the parent
	// Finish()es at the same time, that call could erroneously conclude that the
	// parent can be made available for re-use, even through the child goroutine
	// has a pending call into the parent.
	//
	// 2) Prevent re-allocation of child spans while a Finish()ing parent is in
	// the process of transforming the children into roots and inserting them into
	// the active spans registry. Operating on the registry is done without
	// holding any span's lock, so a race with a child's Finish() could result in
	// the registry operating on a re-allocated span.
	//
	// 3) Prevent re-allocation of a Span in between the time that WithParent(s)
	// captures a reference to s and the time when the parent option is used to
	// create the child. Such an inopportune reuse of a span could only happen is
	// the span is Finish()ed concurrently with the creation of its child, which
	// is illegal. Still, we optionally tolerate use-after-Finishes, and this use
	// cannot be tolerated with the reference count protection. Without this
	// protection, the tree of spans in a trace could degenerate into a graph
	// through the introduction of loops. A loop could lead to deadlock due to the
	// fact that we lock multiple spans at once. The lock ordering convention is
	// that the parent needs to be locked before the child, which ensures
	// deadlock-freedom in the absence of loops.
	// For example:
	// 1. parent := tr.StartSpan()
	// 2. parentOpt := WithParent(parent)
	// 3. parent.Finish()
	// 4. child := tr.StartSpan(parentOpt)
	// If "parent" would be re-allocated as "child", then child would have itself
	// as a parent. The use of parentOpt in step 4) after parent was finished in
	// step 3) is a use-after-Finish of parent; it is illegal and, if detection is
	// enabled, it might be detected as such. However, if span pooling and re-use
	// is enabled, then the detection is not realiable (it does not catch cases
	// where a span is re-used before a reference to it taken before the prior
	// Finish() is used).
	// A span having itself as a parent is just the trivial case of the problem;
	// loops of arbitrary length are also possible. For example, for a loop of
	// length 2:
	// 1. Say we have span A as a parent with span B as a child (A -> B).
	// 2. parentA := WithParent(A)
	// 3. parentB := WithParent(B)
	// 4. A.Finish(); B.Finish();
	// 5. X := tr.StartSpan(parentA); Y := tr.StartSpan(parentB);
	// If B is re-used as X, and A is re-used as Y, we get the following graph:
	//  B<-┐
	//  |  |
	//  └->A
	//
	// We avoid these hazards by having WithParent(s) increment s' refCnt. Spans
	// are not re-used while the creation of a child is pending. Spans can be
	// Finish()ed while the creation of the child is pending, in which case the
	// creation of the child will reliably detect the use-after-Finish (and turn
	// it into a no-op if configured to tolerate such illegal uses).
