// Span is the tracing Span that we use in CockroachDB. Depending on the tracing
// configuration, it can hold anywhere between zero and three destinations for
// trace information:
//
// 1. external OpenTelemetry-compatible trace collector (Jaeger, Zipkin, Lightstep),
// 2. /debug/requests endpoint (net/trace package); mostly useful for local debugging
// 3. CRDB-internal trace span (powers SQL session tracing).
//
// When there is no need to allocate either of these three destinations,
// a "noop span", i.e. an immutable *Span wrapping the *Tracer, may be
// returned, to allow starting additional nontrivial Spans from the return
// value later, when direct access to the tracer may no longer be available.
//
// The CockroachDB-internal Span (crdbSpan) is more complex because
// rather than reporting to some external sink, the caller's "owner"
// must propagate the trace data back across process boundaries towards
// the root of the trace span tree; see WithParent
// and WithRemoteParent, respectively.
//
// Additionally, the internal span type also supports turning on, stopping,
// and restarting its data collection (see Span.StartRecording), and this is
// used extensively in SQL session tracing.
