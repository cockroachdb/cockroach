type parentOption spanRef

// WithParent instructs StartSpan to create a child Span from a (local) parent
// Span.
//
// In case when the parent span is created with a different Tracer (generally,
// when the parent lives in a different process), WithRemoteParentFromSpanMeta should be
// used.
//
// WithParent will be a no-op (i.e. the span resulting from
// applying this option will be a root span, just as if this option hadn't been
// specified) in the following cases:
// - if `sp` is nil
// - if `sp` is a no-op span
// - if `sp` is a sterile span (i.e. a span explicitly marked as not wanting
//   children). Note that the singleton Tracer.noop span is marked as sterile,
//   which makes this condition mostly encompass the previous one, however in
//   theory there could be no-op spans other than the singleton one.
//
// The child inherits the parent's log tags. The data collected in the
// child trace will be retrieved automatically when the parent's data is
// retrieved, meaning that the caller has no obligation (and in fact
// must not) manually propagate the recording to the parent Span.
//
// The child will start recording if the parent is recording at the time
// of child instantiation. If the parent span is not recording, the child
// could be a "noop span" (depending on whether the Tracer is configured
// to trace to an external tracing system) which does not support
// recording, unless the WithForceRealSpan option is passed to StartSpan.
//
// By default, children are derived using a ChildOf relationship,
// which corresponds to the expectation that the parent span will
// wait for the child to Finish(). If this expectation does not hold,
// WithFollowsFrom should be added to the StartSpan invocation.
//
// WithParent increments sp's reference count. As such, the resulting option
// must be passed to StartSpan(opt). Once passed to StartSpan(opt), opt cannot
// be reused. The child span will be responsible for ultimately doing the
// decrement. The fact that WithParent takes a reference on sp is important to
// avoid the possibility of deadlocks when buggy code uses a Span after Finish()
// (which is illegal). See comments on Span.refCnt for details. By taking the
// reference, it becomes safe (from a deadlock perspective) to call
// WithParent(sp) concurrently with sp.Finish(). Note that calling
// WithParent(sp) after sp was re-allocated cannot result in deadlocks
// regardless of the reference counting.

	// below.

//
// For the purposes of trace recordings, there's no mechanism ensuring that the
// child's recording will be passed to the parent span. When that's desired, it
// has to be done manually by calling Span.GetRecording() and propagating the
// result to the parent by calling Span.ImportRemoteSpans().
//
// The canonical use case for this is around RPC boundaries, where a server
// handling a request wants to create a child span descending from a parent on a
// remote machine.
