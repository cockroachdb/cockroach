// We've decided in times immemorial that always returning UTC is a good policy
// across the cluster so that all the timestamps print uniformly across
// different nodes, and also because we were afraid that timestamps leak into
// SQL Datums, and there the timestamp matters. Years later, it's not clear
// whether this was a good decision since it's forcing the nasty implementation
// below.

	// HACK: instead of doing t = t.UTC(), we reach inside the
	// struct and set the location manually. UTC() strips the monotonic clock reading
	// from t, for no good reason: https://groups.google.com/g/golang-nuts/c/dyPTdi6oem8
	// Stripping the monotonic part has bad consequences:
	// 1. We lose the benefits of the monotonic clock reading.
	// 2. On OSX, only the monotonic clock seems to have nanosecond resolution. If
	// we strip it, we only get microsecond resolution. Besides generally sucking,
	// microsecond resolution is not enough to guarantee that consecutive
	// timeutil.Now() calls don't return the same instant. This trips up some of
	// our tests, which assume that they can measure any duration of time.
	// 3. time.Since(t) does one less system calls when t has a monotonic reading,
	// making it twice as fast as otherwise:
	// https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.17.2:src/time/time.go;l=878;drc=refs%2Ftags%2Fgo1.17.2
