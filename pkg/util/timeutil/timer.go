// The Timer type represents a single event. When the Timer expires,
// the current time will be sent on Timer.C.
//
// This timer implementation is an abstraction around the standard
// library's time.Timer that provides a temporary workaround for the
// issue described in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14038. As
// such, this timer should only be used when Reset is planned to
// be called continually in a loop. For this Reset pattern to work,
// Timer.Read must be set to true whenever a timestamp is read from
// the Timer.C channel. If Timer.Read is not set to true when the
// channel is read from, the next call to Timer.Reset will deadlock.
// This pattern looks something like:
//
//	var timer timeutil.Timer
//	defer timer.Stop()
//	for {
//	    timer.Reset(wait)
//	    select {
//	    case <-timer.C:
//	        timer.Read = true
//	        ...
//	    }
//	}
//
// Note that unlike the standard library's Timer type, this Timer will
// not begin counting down until Reset is called for the first time, as
// there is no constructor function. The zero value for Timer is ready
// to use.
//
// TODO(nvanbenschoten): follow https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37196
// and remove this abstraction once it's no longer needed. There's some
// recent progress in https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/568341.
