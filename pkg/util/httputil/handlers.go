// EtagHandler creates an http.Handler middleware that wraps another HTTP
// handler, adding support for the If-None-Match request header and ETag
// response header based on pre-computed file hashes. All responses include an
// ETag header with the hash provided in contentHashes. When a client provides
// an If-None-Match header with the hash found in contentHashes, no file is
// served and an HTTP 304 with no body is sent to clients instead, to indicate
// that the client's stale cache entry is still valid.
//
//   - contentHashes is a map of URL path (including a leading "/") to the ETag
//     value to use for that file
//   - next is the next handler in the http.Handler chain, used
