// Resource is an interface that represents a quantity which is being
// pooled and allocated. It is any quantity that can be subdivided and

// internally the *IntAlloc is used as a resource.

	// Merge.

	// not intend to use.

	// It is up to the implementer to decide if it makes sense to return a
	// zero-valued, non-nil Resource or nil as unused when acquiring all of the
	// passed Resource. If nil is returned and there is a notion of acquiring a
	// zero-valued Resource unit from the pool then those acquisitions may need to
	// wait until the pool is non-empty before proceeding. Those zero-valued
	// acquisitions will still need to wait to be at the front of the queue. It
