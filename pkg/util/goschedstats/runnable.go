// control that wants to react extremely quickly to cpu changes. Past
// experience in other systems (not CockroachDB) motivated not consuming a
// smoothed signal for admission control. The CockroachDB setting may possibly
// be different enough for that experience to not apply, but changing this to
// a smoothed value (say over 1s) should be done only after thorough load
// testing under adversarial load conditions (specifically, we need to react
// quickly to large drops in runnable due to blocking on IO, so that we don't
// waste cpu -- a workload that fluctuates rapidly between being IO bound and
// cpu bound could stress the usage of a smoothed signal).
