	// In case there is no log directory, we must be careful to not

	// to fd 2, for example the Go runtime when processing an internal
	// assertion error, to interleave its writes going to stderr
	// together with a logger that wants to insert log redaction markers
	// also on stderr. Because the log code cannot control this
