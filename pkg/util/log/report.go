// reportOrPanic is expected to be injected by pkg/logcrash to avoid a circular
// dependency.
//
// reportOrPanic, once injected, either reports an error to sentry, if run from a
// release binary, or panics, if triggered in tests. This is intended to be used for
// failing assertions which are recoverable but serious enough to report and to
// cause tests to fail.
//
// NB: The format string should not contain any sensitive data, and unsafe reportables
// will be redacted before reporting.
//
// NB2: We provide a default definition that always panics. This is because pkg/logcrash
// injects the real definition in its `init()` function, but this function is used
// in pkg/util/log's *own* `init()` function. pkg/logcrash imports pkg/util/log, not
// the other way around, so pkg/util/log's `init()` function is called first.
// Therefore, to avoid a nil reference in the event that our own package's `init()`
// needs to use reportOrPanic, we provide this default definition.
