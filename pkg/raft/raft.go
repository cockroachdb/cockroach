				// If the follower has an uncommitted log tail, we would end up
				// probing one by one until we hit the common prefix.
				//
				// For example, if the leader has:
				//
				//   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
				//              -----------------
				//   term (L)   1 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 5
				//   term (F)   1 1 1 1 2 2
				//
				// Then, after sending an append anchored at (idx=9,term=5) we
				// would receive a RejectHint of 6 and LogTerm of 2. Without the
				// code below, we would try an append at index 6, which would
				// fail again.
				//
				// However, looking only at what the leader knows about its own
				// log and the rejection hint, it is clear that a probe at index
				// 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 must fail as well:
				//
				// For all of these indexes, the leader's log term is larger than
				// the rejection's log term. If a probe at one of these indexes
				// succeeded, its log term at that index would match the leader's,
				// i.e. 3 or 5 in this example. But the follower already told the
				// leader that it is still at term 2 at index 6, and since the
				// log term only ever goes up (within a log), this is a contradiction.
				//
				// At index 1, however, the leader can draw no such conclusion,
				// as its term 1 is not larger than the term 2 from the
				// follower's rejection. We thus probe at 1, which will succeed
				// in this example. In general, with this approach we probe at
				// most once per term found in the leader's log.
				//
				// There is a similar mechanism on the follower (implemented in
				// handleAppendEntries via a call to findConflictByTerm) that is
				// useful if the follower has a large divergent uncommitted log
				// tail[1], as in this example:
				//
				//   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
				//              -----------------
				//   term (L)   1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 7
				//   term (F)   1 3 3 4 4 5 5 5 6
				//
				// Naively, the leader would probe at idx=9, receive a rejection
				// revealing the log term of 6 at the follower. Since the leader's
				// term at the previous index is already smaller than 6, the leader-
				// side optimization discussed above is ineffective. The leader thus
				// probes at index 8 and, naively, receives a rejection for the same
				// index and log term 5. Again, the leader optimization does not improve
				// over linear probing as term 5 is above the leader's term 3 for that
				// and many preceding indexes; the leader would have to probe linearly
				// until it would finally hit index 3, where the probe would succeed.
				//
				// Instead, we apply a similar optimization on the follower. When the
				// follower receives the probe at index 8 (log term 3), it concludes
				// that all of the leader's log preceding that index has log terms of
				// 3 or below. The largest index in the follower's log with a log term
				// of 3 or below is index 3. The follower will thus return a rejection
				// for index=3, log term=3 instead. The leader's next probe will then
				// succeed at that index.
				//
				// [1]: more precisely, if the log terms in the large uncommitted
				// tail on the follower are larger than the leader's. At first,
				// it may seem unintuitive that a follower could even have such
				// a large tail, but it can happen:
				//
				// 1. Leader appends (but does not commit) entries 2 and 3, crashes.
				//   idx        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
				//              -----------------
				//   term (L)   1 2 2     [crashes]
				//   term (F)   1
				//   term (F)   1
				//
				// 2. a follower becomes leader and appends entries at term 3.
				//              -----------------
				//   term (x)   1 2 2     [down]
				//   term (F)   1 3 3 3 3
				//   term (F)   1
