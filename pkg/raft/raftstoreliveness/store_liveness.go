type StoreLiveness interface {

	// SupportFor returns the epoch of the current uninterrupted period of Store
	// Liveness support for the specified replica's remote store (S_remote) from
	// the local replica's store (S_local), and a boolean indicating whether
	// S_local is currently supporting S_remote.

	// S_local, as Store Liveness heartbeat acknowledgement messages may be lost
	// or delayed. However, S_local will never be unaware of support it is
	// providing.

	// If S_local cannot map the replica ID to a store ID, false will be returned.
	// It is therefore important to ensure that the replica ID to store ID mapping
	// is not lost during periods of support.

	// SupportFrom returns the epoch of the current uninterrupted period of Store
	// Liveness support from the specified replica's remote store (S_remote) for
	// the local replica's store (S_local), the timestamp which the support is
	// provided until (an expiration), and a boolean indicating whether S_local is
	// currently supported by S_remote.

	// callers can rely on getting support from peers by calling SupportFrom.
	//
	// Note that even if StoreLiveness isn't currently active, replicas should not
	// break any previously made promises back when it was. As such, calls to
	// SupportFor should be made regardless of whether StoreLiveness is currently
	// active or not, which is what prompts the "SupportFrom" prefix.

	// the present time and has therefore expired. If the method returns false,
	// the timestamp is still in the future and still provides support up to that
	// point in time.
