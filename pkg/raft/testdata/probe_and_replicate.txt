# This test creates a complete Raft log configuration and demonstrates how a
# leader probes and replicates to each of its followers. The log configuration
# constructed is almost[*] identical to the one present in Figure 7 of the raft
# paper (https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf), which looks like:
#       
#      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12
# n1: [1][1][1][4][4][5][5][6][6][6]
# n2: [1][1][1][4][4][5][5][6][6]
# n3: [1][1][1][4]
# n4: [1][1][1][4][4][5][5][6][6][6][6]
# n5: [1][1][1][4][4][5][5][6][7][7][7][7]
# n6: [1][1][1][4][4][4][4]
# n7: [1][1][1][2][2][2][3][3][3][3][3]
#
# Once in this state, we then elect node 1 as the leader and stabilize the
# entire raft group. This demonstrates how a newly elected leader probes for
# matching indexes, overwrites conflicting entries, and catches up all
# followers.
#
# [*] the only differences are:
# 1. n5 is given a larger uncommitted log tail, which is used to demonstrate a
#    follower-side probing optimization.
# 2. the log indexes are shifted by 10 in this test because add-nodes wants to
#    start with an index > 1.
#


# Set up the log configuration. This is mostly unintersting, but the order of
# each leadership change and the nodes that are allowed to hear about them is
# very important. Most readers of this test can skip this section.
