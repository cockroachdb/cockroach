# Tests that CheckQuorum causes a leader to step down if it hasn't heard from a
# quorum of followers in the past election timeout interval.
#
# Also tests that votes are rejected when there is a current leader. In the Raft
# thesis this is part of PreVote, but etcd/raft enables this via CheckQuorum.

# TODO(ibrahim): Remove this test once store liveness is on by default since we
# have the test checkquorum outside the mixedversions directory that assumes
# that assumes that store liveness is enabled.
