# Regression test that verifies that learners can vote. This holds only in the
# sense that if a learner is asked to vote, a candidate believes that they are a
# voter based on its current config, which may be more recent than that of the
# learner. If learners which are actually voters but don't know it yet don't
# vote in that situation, the raft group may end up unavailable despite a quorum
# of voters (as of the latest config) being available.
