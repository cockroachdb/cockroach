# This test verifies the DisableConfChangeValidation setting.
# With it set, raft should allow configuration changes to enter the log even
# if they appear to be incompatible with the currently active configuration.
#
# The test sets up a single-voter group that applies entries one at a time.
# Then it proposes a bogus entry followed by a conf change. When the bogus entry
# has applied, a second (compatible, but the node doesn't know this yet)
# configuration change is proposed. That configuration change is accepted into
# the log since due to DisableConfChangeValidation=true.
