# TODO(arul): Consider adding a directive for the leader's support tracker and
# printing it out here. We can see that 1 isn't supporting itself by the
# "leader doesn't support itself" log line, but we don't have a reject message
# in the test output. We should confirm that the support tracking is as expected
# by printing out the SupportTracker on the leader.
