# TestSnapshotSucceedViaAppResp regression tests the situation in which a snap-
# shot is sent to a follower at the most recent index (i.e. the snapshot index
# is the leader's last index is the committed index). In that situation, a bug
# in the past left the follower in probing status until the next log entry was
# committed.
#
# See https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10308 for additional background.

# Turn off output during the setup of the test.
