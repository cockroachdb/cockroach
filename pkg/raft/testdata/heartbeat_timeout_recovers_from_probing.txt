# This test checks that if a fully caught-up follower transitions
# into StateProbe (for example due to a call to ReportUnreachable), the
# leader will react to a subsequent heartbeat response from the probing
# follower by sending an empty MsgApp, the response of which restores
# StateReplicate for the follower. In other words, we don't end up in
# a stable state with a fully caught up follower in StateProbe.

# Turn off output during the setup of the test.
