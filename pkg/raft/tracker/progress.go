// Progress represents a followerâ€™s progress in the view of the leader. Leader
// maintains progresses of all followers, and sends entries to the follower
// based on its progress.
//
// NB(tbg): Progress is basically a state machine whose transitions are mostly
// strewn around `*raft.raft`. Additionally, some fields are only used when in a
// certain State. All of this isn't ideal.
//
// TODO(pav-kv): consolidate all flow control state changes here. Much of the
// transitions in raft.go logically belong here.
type Progress struct {
	// Match is the index up to which the follower's log is known to match the
	// leader's.
	Match uint64
	// Next is the log index of the next entry to send to this follower. All
	// entries with indices in (Match, Next) interval are already in flight.
	//
	// Invariant: 0 <= Match < Next.
	// NB: it follows that Next >= 1.
	//
	// In StateSnapshot, Next == PendingSnapshot + 1.
	Next uint64

	// SentCommit is the highest commit index in flight to the follower.
	//
	// Generally, it is monotonic, but con regress in some cases, e.g. when
	// converting to `StateProbe` or when receiving a rejection from a follower.
	//
	// In StateSnapshot, SentCommit == PendingSnapshot == Next-1.
	SentCommit uint64

	// MatchCommit is the commit index at which the follower is known to match the
	// leader. It is durable on the follower.
	// Best-effort invariant: MatchCommit <= SentCommit
	// It's a best-effort invariant because it doesn't really affect correctness.
	// The worst case if MatchCommit > SentCommit is that the leader will send
	// and extra MsgApp to the follower.
	MatchCommit uint64

	// State defines how the leader should interact with the follower.
	//
	// When in StateProbe, leader sends at most one replication message
	// per heartbeat interval. It also probes actual progress of the follower.
	//
	// When in StateReplicate, leader optimistically increases next
	// to the latest entry sent after sending replication message. This is
	// an optimized state for fast replicating log entries to the follower.
	//
	// When in StateSnapshot, leader should have sent out snapshot
	// before and stops sending any replication message.
	State StateType

	// PendingSnapshot is used in StateSnapshot and tracks the last index of the
	// leader at the time at which it realized a snapshot was necessary. This
	// matches the index in the MsgSnap message emitted from raft.
	//
	// While there is a pending snapshot, replication to the follower is paused.
	// The follower will transition back to StateReplicate if the leader
	// receives an MsgAppResp from it that reconnects the follower to the
	// leader's log (such an MsgAppResp is emitted when the follower applies a
	// snapshot). It may be surprising that PendingSnapshot is not taken into
	// account here, but consider that complex systems may delegate the sending
	// of snapshots to alternative datasources (i.e. not the leader). In such
	// setups, it is difficult to manufacture a snapshot at a particular index
	// requested by raft and the actual index may be ahead or behind. This
	// should be okay, as long as the snapshot allows replication to resume.
	//
	// The follower will transition to StateProbe if ReportSnapshot is called on
	// the leader; if SnapshotFinish is passed then PendingSnapshot becomes the
	// basis for the next attempt to append. In practice, the first mechanism is
	// the one that is relevant in most cases. However, if this MsgAppResp is
	// lost (fallible network) then the second mechanism ensures that in this
	// case the follower does not erroneously remain in StateSnapshot.
	PendingSnapshot uint64

	// RecentActive is true if the progress is recently active. Receiving any
	// messages from the corresponding follower indicates the progress is active.
	// Also, it's set to true on every heartbeat timeout if the follower is
	// fortifying the leader.
	// RecentActive can be reset to false after an election timeout.
	// This is always true on the leader.
	RecentActive bool

	// MsgAppProbesPaused is used when the MsgApp flow to a node is throttled.
	// This happens in StateProbe, or StateReplicate with saturated Inflights. In
	// both cases, we need to continue sending MsgApp once in a while to guarantee
	// progress, but we only do so when MsgAppProbesPaused is false to avoid
	// spinning.
	// MsgAppProbesPaused is reset on the next MsgHeartbeatResp from the follower,
	// or on next heartbeat timeout if the follower's store supports the leader's
	// store.
	// See IsPaused(), ShouldSendEntries(), and ShouldSendMsgApp().
	MsgAppProbesPaused bool

	// Inflights is a sliding window for the inflight messages.
	// Each inflight message contains one or more log entries.
	// The max number of entries per message is defined in raft config as MaxSizePerMsg.
	// Thus inflight effectively limits both the number of inflight messages
	// and the bandwidth each Progress can use.
	// When inflights is Full, no more message should be sent.
	// When a leader sends out a message, the index of the last
	// entry should be added to inflights. The index MUST be added
