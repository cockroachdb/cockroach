// Package migration captures the facilities needed to define and execute
// migrations for a crdb cluster. These migrations can be arbitrarily long
// running, are free to send out arbitrary requests cluster wide, change
// internal DB state, and much more. They're typically reserved for crdb
// internal operations and state. Each migration is idempotent in nature, is
// associated with a specific cluster version, and executed when the cluster
// version is made activate on every node in the cluster.
//
// Examples of migrations that apply would be migrations to move all raft state
// from one storage engine to another, or purging all usage of the replicated
// truncated state in KV. A "sister" package of interest is pkg/sqlmigrations.

// Migration defines a program to be executed once every node in the cluster is
// (a) running a specific binary version, and (b) has completed all prior
// migrations.
//
// Each migration is associated with a specific internal cluster version and is
// idempotent in nature. When setting the cluster version (via `SET CLUSTER
// SETTING version`), a manager process determines the set of migrations needed
// to bridge the gap between the current active cluster version, and the target
// one.
//
// To introduce a migration, introduce a version key in pkg/clusterversion, and
// introduce a corresponding internal cluster version for it. See [1] for
// details. Following that, define a Migration in this package and add it to the
// Registry. Be sure to key it in with the new cluster version we just added.
// During cluster upgrades, once the operator is able to set a cluster version
// setting that's past the version that was introduced (typically the major
// release version the migration was introduced in), the manager will execute
// the defined migration before letting the upgrade finalize.

// EveryNode invokes the given closure (named by the informational parameter op)

// so, while accounting for the possibility of new nodes being added to the
// cluster in the interim, is provided by the following structure:
//   (a) We'll retrieve the list of node IDs for all nodes in the system
//   (b) For each node, we'll invoke the closure
//   (c) We'll retrieve the list of node IDs again to account for the
//       possibility of a new node being added during (b)
//   (d) If there any discrepancies between the list retrieved in (a)
//       and (c), we'll invoke the closure each node again
//   (e) We'll continue to loop around until the node ID list stabilizes
//
// By the time EveryNode returns, we'll have thus invoked the closure against
// every node in the cluster.
//
// To consider one example of how this primitive is used, let's consider our use
// of it to bump the cluster version. After we return, given all nodes in the
// cluster will have their cluster versions bumped, and future node additions
// will observe the latest version (through the join RPC). This lets us author
// migrations that can assume that a certain version gate has been enabled on
// all nodes in the cluster, and will always be enabled for any new nodes in the
// system.
//
// It may be possible however that right after we return, a new node may join.
// This means that some migrations may have to be split up into two version
// bumps: one that phases out the old version (i.e. stops creation of stale data
// or behavior) and a clean-up version, which removes any vestiges of the stale
// data/behavior, and which, when active, ensures that the old data has vanished
// from the system. This is similar in spirit to how schema changes are split up
// into multiple smaller steps that are carried out sequentially.

	// TODO(irfansharif): We'll need to introduce fence/noop versions in order

	// It's instructive to walk through how we expect a version migration from
	// v21.1 to v21.2 to take place, and how we would behave in the presence of
	// new v21.1 or v21.2 nodes being added to the cluster during.
	//   - All nodes are running v21.1
	//   - All nodes are rolled into v21.2 binaries, but with active cluster
	//     version still as v21.1
	//   - The first version bump will be into v21.2.0-1noop
	//   - Validation for setting active cluster version to v21.2.0-1noop first
	//     checks to see that all nodes are running v21.2 binaries
	// Then concurrently:
	//   - A new node is added to the cluster, but running binary v21.1
	//   - We try bumping the cluster gates to v21.2.0-1noop
	//
	// If the v21.1 nodes manages to sneak in before the version bump, it's
	// fine as the version bump is a no-op one. Any subsequent bumps (including
	// the "actual" one bumping to v21.2.0) will fail during validation.
	//
	// If the v21.1 node is only added after v21.2.0-1noop is active, it won't
	// be able to actually join the cluster (it'll be prevented by the join
	// RPC).
	//
	// It would be nice to only contain this "fence" version tag within this
	// package. Perhaps by defining yet another proto version type, but for
	// pkg/migrations internal use only? I think the UX we want for engineers
	// defining migrations is that they'd only care about introducing the next
	// version key within pkg/clusterversion, and registering a corresponding
	// migration for it here.
