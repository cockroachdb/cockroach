//
// TODO(dan): Consider changing all of this validation to be based on the commit
// timestamp as given back by kv.Txn. This doesn't currently work for
// nontransactional read-only ops (i.e. single read or batch of only reads) but
// that could be fixed by altering the API to communicating the timestamp back.

	//
	// Concretely a transaction:
	// - Write k1@t2 -> v1
	// - Read k2 -> v2
	// - Scan [k3,k5) -> [v3,v4]
	// - Delete k5@t2 -> <nil> (MVCC delete writes tombstone value)
	// - Read k5 -> <nil>
	//
	// And what was present in KV after this and some other transactions:
	// - k1@t2, v1
	// - k1@t3, v5
	// - k2@t1, v2
	// - k2@t3, v6
	// - k3@t0, v3
	// - k4@t2, v4
	// - k5@t1, v7
	// - k5@t2, <nil>
	//
	// Each of the operations in the transaction, if taken individually, has some
	// window at which it was valid. The Write was only valid for a commit exactly
	// at t2: [t2,t2). This is because each Write's mvcc timestamp is the timestamp
	// of the txn commit. The Read would have been valid for [t1,t3) because v2 was
	// written at t1 and overwritten at t3. The scan would have been valid for
	// [t2,∞) because v3 was written at t0 and v4 was written at t2 and neither were
	// overwritten.  The Delete, same as the Write, is valid at the timestamp of
	// the txn commit, as it is simply a Write with an empty (nil) value.  The
	// final Read, it is worth noting, could be valid at two disjoint timespans
	// that must be considered: [-∞, t1), and [t2,∞).
	//
	//
	// As long as there is at least one time span in which all operations
	// overlap validly, we're good. However, if another write had a timestamp of
	// t3, then there is no timestamp at which the transaction could have
	// committed, which is a violation of our consistency guarantees.
	// Similarly if there was some read that was only valid from [t1,t2).
	// While Reads of concrete values only ever have one valid timespan, with
	// the introduction of Deletes, a Read that returns <nil> may have multiple
	// valid timespans (i.e. before the key existed, after it was deleted).
	//
	// Listen up, this is where it gets tricky. Within a transaction, if the same
	// key is written more than once, only the last one will ever be materialized
	// in KV (and be sent out over the RangeFeed). However, any reads in between
	// will see the overwritten values. This means that each transaction needs its
	// own view of KV when determining what is and is not valid.
	//
	// Concretely:
	// - Read k -> <nil>
	// - Write k -> v1
	// - Read k -> v1
	// - Write k -> v2
	// - Read k -> v2
	//
	// This is okay, but if we only use the writes that come out of RangeFeed to
	// compute our read validities, then there would be no time at which v1 could
	// have been read. So, we have to "layer" the k -> v1 write on top of our
	// RangeFeed output. At the same time, it would not have been valid for the
	// first or second read to see v2 because when they ran that value hadn't
	// been written yet.
	//
	// So, what we do to compute the read validity time windows is first hide all
	// the writes the transaction eventually did in some "view". Then step through
	// it, un-hiding each of them as we encounter each write, and using the
	// current state of the view as we encounter each read. Luckily this is easy
