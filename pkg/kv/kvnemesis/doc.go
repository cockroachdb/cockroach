// Package kvnemesis exercises the KV api with random traffic and then validates
// that the observed behaviors are consistent with our guarantees.
//
// A set of Operations are generated which represent usage of the public KV api.
// These include both "workload" operations like Gets and Puts as well as
// "admin" operations like rebalances. These Operations can be handed to an
// Applier, which runs them against the KV api and records the results.
//
// Operations do allow for concurrency (this testing is much less interesting
// otherwise), which means that the state of the KV map is not recoverable from
// _only_ the input. TODO(dan): We can use RangeFeed to recover the exact KV
// history. This plus some Kyle magic can be used to check our transactional
// guarantees.
