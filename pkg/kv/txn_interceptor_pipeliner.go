// txnPipeliner is a txnInterceptor that pipelines transactional writes by using
// asynchronous consensus. The interceptor then tracks all writes that have been
// asynchronously proposed through Raft and ensures that all interfering
// requests chain on to them by first proving that the async writes succeeded.
// The interceptor also ensures that when committing a transaction all writes
// that have been proposed but not proven to have succeeded are first checked
// before committing. These async writes are referred to as "in-fight writes"
// and this process of proving that an in-flight write succeeded is called
// "proving" the write. Once writes are proven to have finished, they are
// considered "stable".
//
// Chaining on to in-flight async writes is important for two main reasons to
// txnPipeliner:
//
// 1. requests proposed to Raft will not necessarily succeed. For any number of
//    reasons, the request may make it through Raft and be discarded or fail to
//    ever even be replicated. A transaction must check that all async writes
//    succeeded before committing. However, when these proposals do fail, their
//    errors aren't particularly interesting to a transaction. This is because
//    these errors are not deterministic Transaction-domain errors that a
//    transaction must adhere to for correctness such as conditional-put errors or
//    other symptoms of constraint violations. These kinds of errors are all
//    discovered during write *evaluation*, which an async write will perform
//    synchronously before consensus. Any error during consensus is outside of the
//    Transaction-domain and can always trigger a transaction retry.
//
// 2. transport layers beneath the txnPipeliner do not provide strong enough
//    ordering guarantees between concurrent requests in the same transaction to
//    avoid needing explicit chaining. For instance, DistSender uses unary gRPC
//    requests instead of gRPC streams, so it can't natively expose strong ordering
//    guarantees. Perhaps more importantly, even when a command has acquired latches
//    and evaluated on a Replica, it is not guaranteed to be applied before
//    interfering commands. This is because the command may be retried outside of
//    the serialization of the spanlatch manager for any number of reasons, such as
//    leaseholder changes. When the command re-acquired its latches, it's possible
//    that interfering commands may jump ahead of it. To combat this, the
//    txnPipeliner uses chaining to throw an error when these re-orderings would
//    have affected the order that transactional requests evaluate in.
//
// The interceptor proves all in-flight writes before committing a transaction
// by tacking on a QueryIntent request for each one to the front of an
// EndTransaction(Commit=true) requests. The result of this is that the
// EndTransaction needs to wait at the DistSender level for all of QueryIntent
// requests to succeed at before executing itself [1]. This is a little
// unfortunate because a transaction could have accumulated a large number of
// in-flight writes without proving any of them, and the more of these writes
// there are, the more chance querying one of them gets delayed and delays the
// overall transaction.
//
// Three approaches have been considered to address this, all of which revolve
// around the idea that earlier writes in a transaction may have finished
// consensus well before the EndTransaction is sent. Following this logic, it
// would be in the txnPipeliner's best interest to prove in-flight writes as
// early as possible, even if no other overlapping requests force them to be
// proven. The approaches are:
//
// 1. launch a background process after each successful async write to query its
//    intents and wait for it to succeed. This would effectively solve the issue,
//    but at the cost of many more goroutines and many more QueryIntent requests,
//    most of which would be redundant because their corresponding write wouldn't
//    complete until after an EndTransaction synchronously needed to prove them
//    anyway.
//
// 2. to address the issue of an unbounded number of background goroutines
//    proving writes in approach 1, a single background goroutine could be run
//    that repeatedly loops over all in-flight writes and attempts to prove
//    them. This approach was used in an early revision of #26599 and has the nice
//    property that only one batch of QueryIntent requests is ever active at a
//    given time. It may be revisited, but for now it is not used for the same
//    reason as approach 1: most of its QueryIntent requests will be useless
//    because a transaction will send an EndTransaction immediately after sending
//    all of its writes.
//
// 3. turn the KV interface into a streaming protocol (#8360) that could support
//    returning multiple results. This would allow clients to return immediately
//    after a writes "evaluation" phase completed but hold onto a handle to the
//    request and be notified immediately after its "replication" phase completes.
//    This would allow txnPipeliner to prove in-flight writes immediately after
//    they finish consensus without any extra RPCs.
//
// So far, none of these approaches have been integrated.
//
// [1] A proposal called "parallel commits" (#24194) exists that would allow all
//     QueryIntent requests and the EndTransaction request that they are prepended
//     to to be sent by the DistSender in parallel. This would help with this
//     issue by hiding the cost of the QueryIntent requests behind the cost of the
//     "staging" EndTransaction request.
