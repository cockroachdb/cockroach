// txnSpanRefresher is a txnInterceptor that collects the read spans of a
// serializable transaction in the event it gets a serializable retry error. It
// can then use the set of read spans to avoid retrying the transaction if all
// the spans can be updated to the current transaction timestamp.
//
// Serializable isolation mandates that transactions appear to have occurred in
// some total order, where none of their component sub-operations appear to have
// interleaved with sub-operations from other transactions. CockroachDB enforces
// this isolation level by ensuring that all of a transaction's reads and writes
// are performed at the same HLC timestamp. This timestamp is referred to as the
// transaction's commit timestamp.
//
// As a transaction in CockroachDB executes at a certain provisional commit
// timestamp, it lays down intents at this timestamp for any write operations
// and ratchets various timestamp cache entries to this timestamp for any read
// operations. If a transaction performs all of its reads and writes and is able
// to commit at its original provisional commit timestamp then it may go ahead
// and do so. However, for a number of reasons including conflicting reads and
// writes, a transaction may discover that its provisional commit timestamp is
// too low and that it needs to move this timestamp forward to commit.
//
// This poses a problem for operations that the transaction has already
// completed at lower timestamps. Are the effects of these operations still
// valid? The transaction is always free to perform a full restart at a higher
// epoch, but this often requires iterating in a client-side retry loop and
// performing all of the transaction's operations again. Intents are maintained
// across retries to improve the chance that later epochs succeed, but it is
// vastly preferable to avoid re-issuing these operations. Instead, it would be
// ideal if the transaction could "move" each of its operations to its new
// provisional commit timestamp without redoing them entirely.
//
// Only a single write intent can exist on a key and no reads are allowed above
// the intent's timestamp until the intent is resolved, so a transaction is free
// to move any of its intent to a higher timestamp. In fact, a synchronous
// rewrite of these intents isn't even necessary because intent resolution will
// already rewrite the intents at higher timestamp if necessary. So, moving
// write intents to a higher timestamp can be performed implicitly by committing
// their transaction at a higher timestamp. However, unlike intents created by
// writes, timestamp cache entries created by reads only prevent writes on
// overlapping keys from being written at or below their timestamp; they do
// nothing to prevent writes on overlapping keys from being written above their
// timestamp. This means that a transaction is not free to blindly move its
// reads to a higher timestamp because writes from other transaction may have
// already invalidated them. In effect, this means that transactions acquire
// pessimistic write locks and optimistic read locks.
//
// The txnSpanRefresher is in charge of detecting when a transaction may want to
// move its provisional commit timestamp forward and determining whether doing
// so is safe given the reads that it has performed (i.e. its "optimistic read
// locks"). When the interceptor decides to attempt to move a transaction's
// timestamp forward, it first "refreshes" each of its reads. This refreshing
// step revisits all of the key spans that the transaction has read and checks
// whether any writes have occurred between the original time that these span
// were read and the timestamp that the transaction now wants to commit at that
// change the result of these reads. If any read would produce a different
// result at the newer commit timestamp, the refresh fails and the transaction
// is forced to fall back to a full transaction restart. However, if all of the
// reads would produce exactly the same result at the newer commit timestamp,
// the timestamp cache entries for these reads are updated and the transaction
// is free to update its provisional commit timestamp without needing to
// restart.
