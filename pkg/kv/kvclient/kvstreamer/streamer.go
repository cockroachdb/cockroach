// The memory limit handling is achieved by the Streamer guessing the size of
// the response for each request and setting TargetBytes accordingly. The

// - when possible, sorting requests in key order to take advantage of low-level
// Pebble locality optimizations
// - when necessary, buffering the responses received out of order
// - when necessary, caching the responses to short-circuit repeated lookups.
