	// We're estimating the response size as the average over the received
	// responses. Importantly, we divide the total responses' footprint by the
	// number of "started" requests. This allows us to handle partial
	// ScanResponses that need to be resumed across BatchRequests without
	// double-counting them in the denominator of the average computation (which
	// would lead to artificially low estimate, see #103586 for an example).
	//
	// Note that we're multiplying the average by a response size multiple for a
	// couple of reasons:
	//
	// 1. this allows us to fulfill requests that are slightly larger than the
	// current average. For example, imagine that we're processing three
	// requests of sizes 100B, 110B, and 120B sequentially, one at a time.
	// Without the multiple, after the first request, our estimate would be 100B
	// so the second request would come back empty (with ResumeNextBytes=110),
	// so we'd have to re-issue the second request. At that point the average is
	// 105B, so the third request would again come back empty and need to be
	// re-issued with larger TargetBytes. Having the multiple allows us to
	// handle such a scenario without any requests coming back empty. In
	// particular, TPC-H Q17 has similar setup.
	//
	// 2. this allows us to slowly grow the TargetBytes parameter over time when
	// requests can be returned partially multiple times (i.e. Scan requests
	// spanning multiple rows). Consider a case when a single Scan request has
	// to return 1MB worth of data, but each row is only 100B. With the initial
	// estimate of 1KB, every request would always come back with exactly 10
	// rows, and the avg response size would always stay at 1KB. We'd end up
	// issuing 1000 of such requests. Having a multiple here allows us to grow
	// the estimate over time, reducing the total number of requests needed
	// (although the growth is still not fast enough).
	//
	// TODO(yuzefovich): we currently use a simple average over the received
	// responses, but it is likely to be suboptimal because it would be unfair
	// to "large" batches that come in late (i.e. it would not be reactive
	// enough). Consider using another function here.
