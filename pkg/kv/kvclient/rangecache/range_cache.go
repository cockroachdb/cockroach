// If the key is part of a descriptor that we previously had cached (but the
// cache entry is stale), we use that previous descriptor to coalesce all
// requests for keys within it into a single request. Namely, there are three
// possible events that may have happened causing our cache to be stale. For
// each of these, we try to coalesce all requests that will end up on the same
// range post-event together.
//   - Split:  for a split, only the right half of the split will attempt to evict
//     the stale descriptor because only the right half will be sending to
//     the wrong range. Once this stale descriptor is evicted, keys from
//     both halves of the split will miss the cache. Because both sides of
//     the split will now map to the same EvictionToken, it is important to
//     use EvictAndReplace if possible to insert one of the two new descriptors.
//     This way, no requests to that descriptor will ever miss the cache and
//     risk being coalesced into the other request. If this is not possible,
//     the lookup will still work, but it will require multiple lookups, which
//     will be launched in series when requests find that their desired key
//     is outside of the returned descriptor.
//   - Merges: for a merge, the left half of the merge will never notice. The right
//     half of the merge will suddenly find its descriptor to be stale, so
//     it will evict and lookup the new descriptor. We set the key to hash
//     to the start of the stale descriptor for lookup requests to the right
//     half of the merge so that all requests will be coalesced to the same
//     lookupRequest.
//   - Rebal:  for a rebalance, the entire descriptor will suddenly go stale and
//     requests to it will evict the descriptor. We set the key to hash to
//     the start of the stale descriptor for lookup requests to the rebalanced
//     descriptor so that all requests will be coalesced to the same lookupRequest.
