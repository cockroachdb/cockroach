// TestRefreshWithHighPriority reproduces the issue described in #104728:
//   - a normal-priority txn writes an intent on a key,
//   - a high-priority txn reads the key and pushes the timestamp of the
//     normal-priority txn,
//   - something pushes the write timestamp of the high-priority txn (in this
//     test, that's a read-write conflict on another key),
//   - the high-priority txn attempts to refresh before committing but encounters
//     the normal-priority txn's intent again, causing the refresh to fail.
//
// This can potentially repeat indefinitely as the high-priority txn retries,
// causing a livelock. This livelock is not possible after #108190 because
// refresh requests now declare isolated keys and go through the lock table
// where they can push a lower-priority request. In this particular example,
// when the refresh encounters the intent, it returns a WriteIntentError, which
// is handled and a lock is added to the lock table; then, when the refresh
// request retries, it pushes the lower-priority lock-holder's timestamp and
// succeeds.
