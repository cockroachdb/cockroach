// the server is not allowed to mutate anything and this transport makes sure
// they don't. See client.Sender() for more.

// NOTE(andrei): We don't like this transport very much. It's slow, preventing
// us from running clusters with race binaries and, the way it's written, it
// prevents both the client and the server from mutating the BatchRequest. But
// only the server is prohibited (according to the client.Sender interface). In
// fact, we'd like to have the client reuse these requests and mutate them.
// Instead of this transport, we should find other mechanisms ensuring that:
// a) the server doesn't hold on to any memory, and
// b) the server doesn't mutate the request
