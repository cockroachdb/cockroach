// txnSeqNumAllocator is a txnInterceptor in charge of allocating sequence
// numbers to all the individual requests in batches.
//
// Sequence numbers serve a few roles in the transaction model:
//
// 1. they are used to enforce an ordering between read and write operations in a
//    single transaction that go to the same key. Each read request that travels
//    through the interceptor is assigned the sequence number of the most recent
//    write. Each write request that travels through the interceptor is assigned
//    a sequence number larger than any previously allocated.
//
//    This is true even for leaf transaction coordinators. In their case, they are
//    provided the sequence number of the most recent write during construction.
//    Because they only perform read operations and never issue writes, they assign
//    each read this sequence number without ever incrementing their own counter.
//    In this way, sequence numbers are maintained correctly across a distributed
//    tree of transaction coordinators.
//
// 2. they are used to uniquely identify write operations. Because every write
//    request is given a new sequence number, the tuple (txn_id, txn_epoch, seq)
//    uniquely identifies a write operation across an entire cluster. This property
//    is exploited when determining the status of an individual write by looking
//    for its intent. We perform such an operation using the QueryIntent request
//    type when pipelining transactional writes. We will do something similar
//    during the recovery stage of implicitly committed transactions.
//
// 3. they are used to determine whether a batch contains the entire write set
//    for a transaction. See BatchRequest.IsCompleteTransaction.
//
// 4. they are used to provide idempotency for replays and re-issues. The MVCC
//    layer is sequence number-aware and ensures that reads at a given sequence
//    number ignore writes in the same transaction at larger sequence numbers.
//    Likewise, writes at a sequence number become no-ops if an intent with the
//    same sequence is already present. If an intent with the same sequence is not
//    already present but an intent with a larger sequence number is, an error is
//    returned. Likewise, if an intent with the same sequence is present but its
//    value is different than what we recompute, an error is returned.
