// stuckRangeFeedCanceler are a defense-in-depth mechanism to restart rangefeeds that have
// not received events from the KV layer in some time. Rangefeeds are supposed to receive
// regular updates, as at the very least they ought to be receiving closed timestamps.
//
// However, issues[^1] at the KV layer could prevent this.
//
// The canceler is notified via ping() whenever the associated RangeFeed receives an event.
// Should ping() not be called for the configured threshold duration, the provided cancel
// function will be invoked.
//
// This is implemented without incurring nontrivial work on each call to ping().
// Instead, work is done roughly on each threshold interval, which is assumed to
// be large enough (i.e. at least a couple of seconds) to make this negligible.
// Concretely, a timer is set that would invoke the cancellation, and the timer
// is reset on the first call to ping() after the timer is at least half
// expired. That way, we allocate only ~twice per eventCheckInterval, which is
// acceptable.
//
// The canceler detects changes to the configured threshold duration on each call
// to ping(), i.e. in the common case of no stuck rangefeeds, it will ~immediately
// pick up the new value and apply it.
