// txnCommitter is a txnInterceptor that concerns itself with committing and
// rolling back transactions. It intercepts EndTxn requests and coordinates
// their execution. This is accomplished either by issuing them directly with
// proper addressing if they are alone, eliding them if they are not needed, or
// coordinating their execution in parallel with the rest of their batch if they
// are part of a larger set of requests.
//
// The third operation listed, which we define as a "parallel commit", is the
// most interesting. Marking a transaction record as committed in parallel with
// writing the rest of the transaction's intents is a clear win in terms of
// latency - in theory it removes the cost of an entire consensus round-trip
// from a transaction. However, doing so safely comes with extra complication.
// It requires an extension to the transaction model, additional client-side
// logic, buy-in from concurrency control, and specialized support from a
// transaction recovery mechanism. txnCommitter is responsible for the parallel
// commit-specific client-side logic.
//
// Parallel commits works by defining a committed transaction as a transaction
// that meets one of the two following commit conditions:
// 1. a transaction is *explicitly committed* if it has a transaction record with
//    a COMMITTED status
// 2. a transaction is *implicitly committed* if it has a transaction record with
//    a STAGING status and intents written for all writes declared as "in-flight"
//    on the transaction record at equal or lower timestamps than the transaction
//    record's commit timestamp
//
// A transaction may move from satisfying the implicit commit condition to
// satisfying the explicit commit condition. This is desirable because it moves
// the commit condition from a distributed condition to one local to the
// transaction record. Regardless, once either commit condition is satisfied, a
// transaction will remain committed in perpetuity both to itself and to all
// concurrent observers.
//
// The txnCommitter interceptor's role in this is to determine the set of writes
// that will be in-flight during a parallel commit. It collects this set from
// both the writes and the query intent requests that it finds present in the
// same batch as the committing end transaction request. The writes in this
// batch indicate a new intent write and the query intent requests indicate a
// previous pipelined intent write that has not yet been proven as successful.
// Before issuing the batch, the txnCommitter attaches this set to the end
// transaction request.
//
// The txnCommitter then collects the response of the batch when it returns.
// Based on the outcome of the requests in the batch, the interceptor determines
// whether the transaction successfully committed by satisfying the implicit
// commit condition.
//
// If all requests in the batch succeeded (including the EndTxn request) then
// the implicit commit condition is satisfied. The interceptor returns a
// successful response up then stack and launches an async task to make the
// commit explicit by moving the transaction record's status from STAGING to
// COMMITTED.
//
// If all requests did not succeed then the implicit commit condition is not
// satisfied and the transaction is still in-progress (and could still be
// committed or aborted at a later time). There are a number of reasons why
// some of the requests in the final batch may have failed:
// - intent writes: these requests may fail to write an intent due to a logical
//     error like a ConditionFailedError. They also could have succeeded at writing
//     an intent but failed to write it at the desired timestamp because they ran
//     into the timestamp cache or another committed value. In the first case, the
//     txnCommitter will receive an error. In the second, it will generate one in
//     needTxnRetryAfterStaging.
// - query intents: these requests may fail because they discover that one of the
//     previously issued writes has failed; either because it never left an intent
//     or because it left one at too high of a timestamp. In this case, the request
//     will return an error because the requests all have the ErrorIfMissing option
//     set. It will also prevent the write from ever succeeding in the future, which
//     ensures that the transaction will never suddenly become implicitly committed
//     at a later point due to the write eventually succeeding (e.g. after a replay).
// - end txn: this request may fail with a TransactionRetryError for any number of
//     reasons, such as if the transaction's provisional commit timestamp has been
//     pushed past its read timestamp. In all of these cases, an error will be
//     returned and the transaction record will not be staged.
//
// If it is unknown whether all of the requests in the final batch succeeded
// (e.g. due to a network error) then an AmbiguousResultError is returned. The
// logic to enforce this is in DistSender.
//
// In all cases, the interceptor abstracts away the details of this from all
// interceptors above it in the coordinator interceptor stack.
