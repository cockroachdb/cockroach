// txnWriteBuffer is a txnInterceptor that buffers transactional writes until
// commit time. Moreover, it also decomposes read-write KV operations (e.g.
// CPuts, InitPuts) into separate (locking) read and write operations, buffering
// the latter until commit time.
//
// Buffering writes until commit time has four main benefits:
//
// 1. It allows for more batching of writes, which can be more efficient.
// Instead of sending write batches one at a time, we can batch all write
// batches and send the in a single batch at commit time. This is a win even if
// writes would otherwise be pipelined through raft.
//
// 2. It allows for the elimination of redundant writes. If a client writes to
// the same key multiple times in a transaction, only the last write needs to be
// written to the KV layer.
//
// 3. It allows the client to serve read-your-own-writes locally, which can be
// much faster and cheaper than sending them to the leaseholder. This is
// especially true when the leaseholder isn't colocated with the client.
//
// By serving read-your-own-writes locally from the gateway, write buffering
// also avoids the problem of pipeline stalls that can occur when a client reads
// a pipelined write before it has finished replicating through raft. For
// details on pipeline stalls, see txnPipeliner.
//
// 4. It allows clients to passively hit the 1-phase commit fast path, instead
// of requiring clients to carefully construct "auto-commit" BatchRequests to
// make use of the optimization. By buffering writes on the client before
// commit, we avoid immediately disabling the fast path when the client issues
// their first write. Then, at commit time, we flush the buffer and will happen
// to hit the 1-phase commit fast path if all writes end up going to the same
// range.
//
// However, buffering writes comes with some challenges.
//
// The first challenge is that read-only requests need to be aware of any
// buffered writes, as they may need to serve some reads from the buffer
// instead of the KV layer (read-your-own-writes).
//
// Similarly, any read-write requests, such as CPuts, that we decompose into
// separate read and write operations, need to be aware of any buffered writes
// that may affect their read half. The read portion must be served from the
// buffer instead of the KV-layer if the key has already been written to
// previously. However, we aren't guaranteed to have acquired a corresponding
// lock on the key if a buffered write exists for the key -- as such, we must
// still send a locking read request to the KV layer to acquire a lock.
//
// The picture is further complicated when distributed execution is introduced
// into the mix. A read request that is distributed by the client also needs to
// be aware of the write buffer. As such, when constructing a leaf transaction
// to serve a distributed execution read, we must also ship[1] the write buffer
// along.
//
// The second challenge is around the handling of savepoints. In particular,
// when a savepoint is rolled back, we must clear out any writes that happened
// after the (now) rolled back savepoint. This means that if a key is written to
// multiple times in a transaction, we must retain all writes to the key. Note
// that this is only required when the transaction is in progress -- once the
// transaction is ready to commit, only the last value written to the key needs
// to be flushed to the KV layer.
//
// The third challenge is around memory limits and preventing OOMs. As writes
// are buffered in-memory, per-transaction, we need to be careful not to OOM
// nodes by buffering too many writes. To that end, a per-transaction memory
// limit on the write buffer must be enforced. If this limit is exceeded, no
// more writes are buffered, and the buffer (either in its entirety or
// partially[2]) must be force flushed. Force flushing entails sending all
// buffered writes to the KV layer prematurely (i.e. before commit time).
//
// [1] Instead of shipping the entire write buffer, we can constrain this to
// just the portion that overlaps with the span of the read request that's being
// distributed for evaluation by the client.
//
// [2] The decision to flush the buffer in its entirety vs. partially is a
// tradeoff. Flushing the entire buffer is simpler and frees up more memory.
// Flushing the buffer partially preserves some (all but the fourth) of the
// listed benefits of buffering writes for the unflushed portion of the buffer.
