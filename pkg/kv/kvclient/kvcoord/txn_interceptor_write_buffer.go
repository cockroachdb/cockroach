// txnWriteBuffer is a txnInterceptor that buffers transactional writes until
// commit time. Moreover, it also decomposes read-write KV operations (e.g.
// CPuts) into separate (locking) read and write operations, buffering the
// latter until commit time.
//
// Buffering writes until commit time has four main benefits:
//
// 1. It allows for more batching of writes, which can be more efficient.
// Instead of sending write batches one at a time, we can batch all write
// batches and send them in a single batch at commit time. This is a win even if
// writes would otherwise be pipelined through raft.
//
// 2. It allows for the elimination of redundant writes. If a client writes to
// the same key multiple times in a transaction, only the last write needs to be
// written to the KV layer.
//
// 3. It allows the client to serve read-your-own-writes locally, which can be
// much faster and cheaper than sending them to the leaseholder. This is
// especially true when the leaseholder isn't colocated with the client.
//
// By serving read-your-own-writes locally from the gateway, write buffering
// also avoids the problem of pipeline stalls that can occur when a client reads
// a pipelined write before it has finished replicating through raft. For
// details on pipeline stalls, see txnPipeliner.
//
// 4. It allows clients to passively hit the 1-phase commit fast path, instead
// of requiring clients to carefully construct "auto-commit" BatchRequests to
// make use of the optimization. By buffering writes on the client before
// commit, we avoid immediately disabling the fast path when the client issues
// their first write. Then, at commit time, we flush the buffer and will happen
// to hit the 1-phase commit fast path if all writes end up going to the same
// range.
//
// However, buffering writes comes with some challenges.
//
// The first challenge is that read-only requests need to be aware of any
// buffered writes, as they may need to serve some reads from the buffer
// instead of the KV layer (read-your-own-writes).
//
// Similarly, any read-write requests, such as CPuts, that we decompose into
// separate read and write operations, need to be aware of any buffered writes
// that may affect their read half. The read portion must be served from the
// buffer instead of the KV-layer if the key has already been written to
// previously. However, we aren't guaranteed to have acquired a corresponding
// lock on the key if a buffered write exists for the key -- as such, we must
// still send a locking read request to the KV layer to acquire a lock.
//
// The picture is further complicated when distributed execution is introduced
// into the mix. A read request that is distributed by the client also needs to
// be aware of the write buffer. As such, when constructing a leaf transaction
// to serve a distributed execution read, we must also ship[1] the write buffer
// along.
//
// The second challenge is around the handling of savepoints. In particular,
// when a savepoint is rolled back, we must clear out any writes that happened
// after the (now) rolled back savepoint. This means that if a key is written to
// multiple times in a transaction, we must retain all writes to the key. Note
// that this is only required when the transaction is in progress -- once the
// transaction is ready to commit, only the last value written to the key needs
// to be flushed to the KV layer.
//
// The third challenge is around memory limits and preventing OOMs. As writes
// are buffered in-memory, per-transaction, we need to be careful not to OOM
// nodes by buffering too many writes. To that end, a per-transaction memory
// limit on the write buffer must be enforced. If this limit is exceeded, no
// more writes are buffered, and the buffer (either in its entirety or
// partially[2]) must be force flushed. Force flushing entails sending all
// buffered writes to the KV layer prematurely (i.e. before commit time).
//
// [1] Instead of shipping the entire write buffer, we can constrain this to
// just the portion that overlaps with the span of the read request that's being
// distributed for evaluation by the client.
//
// [2] The decision to flush the buffer in its entirety vs. partially is a
// tradeoff. Flushing the entire buffer is simpler and frees up more memory.
// Flushing the buffer partially preserves some (all but the fourth) of the
// listed benefits of buffering writes for the unflushed portion of the buffer.
//
// TODO(arul): In various places below, there's potential to optimize things by
// batch allocating misc objects and pre-allocating some slices.
type txnWriteBuffer struct {
	st *cluster.Settings
	// enabled indicates whether write buffering is currently enabled for the
	// transaction or not. Write buffering may only be enabled on RootTxns, and
	// before the transaction has sent any requests. However, a transaction that
	// has previously buffered writes may flush its buffer and disable write
	// buffering for subsequent requests. This can happen for a few different
	// reasons:
	//
	// 1. If the buffer has exceeded its configured budget, or if the transaction
	// issues a DeleteRange request, we flush the buffer and disable write
	// buffering going forward. In either case, we're dealing with large writing
	// transactions, and there isn't much benefit from write buffering.
	// 2. If the transaction is performing a DDL operation, we flush the buffer
	// and disable write buffering going forward out of an abundance of caution.
	// This is opted into by SQL.
	//
	// As a result, we have a nice invariant: if write buffering is enabled, then
	// all writes performed by the transaction are buffered in memory. We can
	// never have the case where a part of the write set is buffered, and the
	// other part is replicated.
	//
	// In the future, the invariant above allows us to omit checking the AbortSpan
	// for transactions that have buffered writes enabled. The AbortSpan is used
	// to ensure we don't violate read-your-own-write semantics for transactions
	// that have been aborted by a conflicting transaction. As read-your-own-write
	// semantics are upheld by the client, not the server, for transactions that
	// use buffered writes, we can skip the AbortSpan check on the server.
	//
	// We currently track this via two state variables: `enabled` and `flushed`.
	// Writes are only buffered if enabled && !flushed.
