// Generator incrementally constructs KV traffic designed to maximally test edge

//
// The expected usage is that a number of concurrent worker threads will each
// repeatedly ask for a Step, finish executing it, then ask for the next Step.
//
// A Step consists of a single Operation, which is a unit of work that must be
// done serially. It often corresponds 1:1 to a single call to some method on
// the KV api (such as Get or Put), but some Operations have a set of steps
// (such as using a transaction).
//
// Generator in itself is deterministic, but it's intended usage is that
// multiple worker goroutines take turns pulling steps (sequentially) which they
// then execute concurrently. To improve the efficiency of this pattern,
// Generator will track which splits and merges could possibly have taken place
// and takes this into account when generating operations. For example,
// Generator won't take a OpMergeIsSplit step if it has never previously emitted
// a split, but it may emit an OpMerge once it has produced an OpSplit even
// though the worker executing the split may find that the merge has not yet
// been executed.
