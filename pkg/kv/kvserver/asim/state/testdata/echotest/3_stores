# This test tests the distribution helper functions. The invariants are that the
# distributions sum to 1.0 and that the distribution is expected. The input is
# even, skewed, rand, exact: store replica count (1,1,1), and weighted_rand:
# store replica ratio (0.6,0.2,0.2). The output is the distribution for each
# helper function which represent the replica weight distribution across 3
# stores.
