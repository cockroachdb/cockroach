# This test tests the distribution helper functions. The invariants are that the
# distributions sum to 1.0 and that the distribution is expected. The input is
# even, skewed, rand, exact: store replica count (2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1), and
# weighted_rand: store replica ratio
# (0.5,0.1,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05). The output is the
# distribution for each helper function which represent the replica weight
# distribution across 10 stores.
