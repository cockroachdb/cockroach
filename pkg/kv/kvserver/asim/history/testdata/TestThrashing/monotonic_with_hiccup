----
A "basically" monotonic sequence that has a small hiccup near the
beginning. Sadly this currently results in the bulk of the sequence registering
as thrashing, which is not desired in any allocator-related use cases.
Two improvements come to mind:
- epsilon-hysteresis: small changes that are reversed quickly don't count, but
  it's hard to determine what "small" means.
- trend-based: if there is an overall trend, count only total variation
  in the direction opposing the trend. For example, we can count the number
  of upward and downward deltas, and if one direction is dominant, count only
  variation in the other direction.
TODO(tbg): try out and implement trend-based thrashing detection.
