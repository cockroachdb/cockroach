# This test applies a configuration that prioritizes zone constraints, favoring
# the US_East region. As a result, we expect a majority of replicas to be
# distributed across stores numbered 1-12, all within the US_East region. The
# allocation of replicas to stores outside of this region is expected to be
# zero.
