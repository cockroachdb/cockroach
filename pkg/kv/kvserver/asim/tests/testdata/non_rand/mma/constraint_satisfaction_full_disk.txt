# This test verifies that the allocator can satisfy zone constraints when stores
# have limited disk capacity and replicas need to be rebalanced due to disk
# fullness. The test sets up a 9-node cluster across 4 regions (a, b, c, d) with
# 3, 2, 1, and 3 nodes respectively. It creates 10 ranges with 5 replicas each,
# initially placed only on stores s1, s2, s4, s5, s6 (regions a, b, c). Each store
# has a 10GB capacity and each range is 500MiB, making stores s1, s2, s4, s5, s6
# approximately 61% full initially. The span config requires 2 replicas in region
# a, 2 in region b, and 1 in region c, with lease preferences for region a.
#
# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance replicas to satisfy the zone
# constraints while managing disk capacity. Since stores s1 and s2 in region a are
# initially full, some replicas should move to s3 (also in region a) to maintain
# the constraint of 2 replicas in region a while reducing disk pressure. Leases
# should be distributed within region a (s1, s2, s3) due to lease preferences when
# count-based rebalancing is enabled.

# TODO(wenyihu6): for mma-only, why didn't we balance more replicas to s3 before stabilizing?
# TODO(wenyihu6): tests more cases here
# 1. whats happens if zone config started being satisfied but the full-disk
# target is against the goal of zone/lease constraints
# 2. what happens if zone config started being un-satisfied but the full-disk
# target is against the goal of zone/lease constraints
# 3. what happens if count-based rebalancing is against any of these goals ^
