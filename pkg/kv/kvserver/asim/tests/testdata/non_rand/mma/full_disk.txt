# This test verifies that the allocator can rebalance replicas when stores
# have limited disk capacity and some stores become nearly full. The test
# sets up a 5-node cluster where each store has a 10GB capacity. It creates
# 15 ranges with 3 replicas each, where each range is 500MiB in size. The
# initial placement is skewed, causing stores s1, s2, and s3 to have most
# replicas (with s1 at 92% capacity, s2 at 85%, and s3 at 49%), while s4
# and s5 are underutilized at 24% capacity each.
#
# Expected outcome: The allocator should rebalance replicas to distribute
# disk usage evenly across all stores, moving replicas from the fuller
# stores (s1, s2, s3) to the less utilized stores (s4, s5). The final
# distribution should achieve balanced disk usage (~55% on each store) and
# more even replica distribution across all nodes.

# s.t. n1/s1, n2/s2 and n3/s3 will have most replicas initially.
