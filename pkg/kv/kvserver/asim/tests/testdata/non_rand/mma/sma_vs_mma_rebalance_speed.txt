# This test compares SMA vs MMA rebalancing "nimbleness" - how quickly each
# achieves balance when one node is hot due to uniform CPU load.
#
# Background: MMA limits load transfers to ~10% of inflight load before yielding
# for the rebalancing interval (default 1 minute). This causes MMA to take
# significantly longer to achieve balance compared to SMA.
#
# Scenario: 3-node cluster where s1 holds all 200 leases with uniform read load
# creating a CPU hotspot. The load is read-only (rw_ratio=1.0) with
# request_cpu_per_access to generate CPU-only load on the leaseholder.
# This isolates CPU as the only dimension being stressed, making lease
# shedding the natural response.
