# This test verifies that MMA can balance disks when the imbalance is already
# high under a write-heavy workload. In this setting, doing disk based
# rebalancing goes against the goals of CPU and write bandwidth balancing. The
# test creates two nodes with 20 GiB store capacity. The first node has 100
# ranges of 90 MiB each (55% full). The second node has 100 ranges of 1 MiB each
# (1% full). A write-only workload is started that targets both nodes evenly.
#
# Expectation: MMA should perform rebalancing based on disk usage while trying
# to keep CPU utilization and write bandwidth also balanced. The hope is that
# MMA extends the time it takes for the first node to hit high disk-usage
# threshold compared to SMA.
