# This test sets up a 10-node cluster with two workloads: (read-only, high-cpu on lh)
# uniformly across nodes and (write-only, high-write) initially concentrated on s1-s3.
#
# Expected outcome: mma should rebalance replicas and leases to distribute the
# cpu load and write load more evenly across all stores.
