# Add two assertions, the first is a balance assertion. The balance assertion
# requires that when simulation is evaluated that during last 6 ticks (60
# seconds) the max/mean QPS of the cluster does not exceed 1.15.

# The second is a steady state assertion. The steady state assertion requires
# that during the last 6 ticks (60 seconds), the value of QPS per-store doesn't
# increase or decrease by more than 5% of the mean. This type of assertion is
# useful when a stat is balanced but not necessarily stable.

# to take a duration, not ticks.

# printed. If no assertions fail, then OK is printed.
