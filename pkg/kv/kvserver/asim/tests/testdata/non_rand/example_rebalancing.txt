# Add two assertions, the first is a balance assertion. The balance assertion
# requires that when simulation is evaluated that during last 6 ticks (60
# seconds) the max/mean QPS of the cluster does not exceed 1.15.
assertion stat=qps type=balance ticks=6 upper_bound=1.15
----

# The second is a steady state assertion. The steady state assertion requires
# that during the last 6 ticks (60 seconds), the value of QPS per-store doesn't
# increase or decrease by more than 5% of the mean. This type of assertion is
# useful when a stat is balanced but not necessarily stable.
assertion stat=qps type=steady ticks=6 upper_bound=0.05

# The generators are then called and 2 simulation runs, named samples are
# created and evaluated. Each sample has a fixed duration of 3 minutes.
# Following the evaluation, the samples are checked individually against the
# existing assertions, added above. If any assertion fails, the reason is
# printed. If no assertions fail, then OK is printed.

OK

# It is possible to plot the output of a stat, of a selected sample run. Below
# the last sample run is selected and the QPS is plotted per store. This is
# useful to determine the QPS matches out expectations - it should be balanced
# and stable. This should only be done for tests where the seed is given, so
# the output is identical..
