# Update the load generator to use a zipfian distribution instead of a uniform.
# Now the load based splitter must find a split key from a skewed distribution
# repeatedly - if the load split algorithm is good, we should expect the same
# number of splits as the uniform workload. However, that is not the case as we
# require more splits with a zipfian distribution.
