# This test verifies lease preference handling in a 5-node cluster (2 in region a, 3 in region b).
# Tests three configurations:
# 1. Satisfiable: voters in region b, lease preference for region b (no violations)
# 2. Less-preferred: voters in region b, preference for region a then b (1 lease-less-preferred)
# 3. Impossible: voters in region b, preference for region a (1 lease-violating)
#
# Expected: 1 lease-violating and 1 lease-less-preferred violation.
gen_cluster nodes=5 region=(a,b) nodes_per_region=(2,3)

# Set up a single range.
# TODO(tbg): this may be more interesting with a larger number of ranges.
gen_ranges ranges=1 placement_type=even
----

# Setup three span configs, the first span config should produce no violations
# as all the voters are required to be in the same region as the preference.
# The second span config lease preferences will be only satisfiable by a less
# preferred preference (not the first preference in the preference list). The
# last span config will be impossible to satisfy, so should produce a violation.
