# This test verifies load-based splitting behavior in a single-store cluster.
# It tests both uniform and zipfian access patterns to ensure the split
# algorithm works correctly under different load distributions. With a 10k QPS
# load and 2.5k QPS split threshold, we expect approximately 4 splits for
# uniform access and more splits for zipfian due to hotspotting.
