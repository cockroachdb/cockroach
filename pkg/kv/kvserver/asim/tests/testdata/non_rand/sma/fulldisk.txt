# This test verifies that the allocator correctly handles disk fullness by
#  shedding replicas from stores that exceed the storage capacity threshold. It
# sets up a cluster where one store (s5) has significantly less capacity (100 GiB)
# than others (512 GiB), causing it to hit the disk fullness threshold and
# continuously shed replicas to maintain disk usage less than 95%.
