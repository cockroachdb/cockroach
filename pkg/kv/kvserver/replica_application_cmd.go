// replica_application_*.go files provide concrete implementations of

//
// replica_application_state_machine.go  ->  apply.StateMachine
// replica_application_decoder.go        ->  apply.Decoder
// replica_application_cmd.go            ->  apply.Command         (and variants)

// replicatedCmd stores the state required to apply a single raft entry to a
// replica. The state is accumulated in stages which occur in apply.Task. From
// a high level, the command is decoded from a committed raft entry, then if it
// was proposed locally the proposal is populated from the replica's proposals
// map, then the command is staged into a replicaAppBatch by writing its update
// to the batch's engine.Batch and applying its "trivial" side-effects to the
// batch's view of ReplicaState. Then the batch is committed, the side-effects
// are applied and the local result is processed.
