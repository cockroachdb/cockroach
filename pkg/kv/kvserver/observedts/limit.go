// LimitTxnMaxTimestamp limits the transaction's max timestamp so that it
// respects any timestamp already observed on the leaseholder's node. This
// prevents unnecessary uncertainty interval restarts caused by reading a value
// written at a timestamp between txn.Timestamp and txn.MaxTimestamp.
//
// The lease's start time is also taken into consideration to ensure that a
// lease transfer does not result in the observed timestamp for this node being
// inapplicable to data previously written by the former leaseholder. To wit:
//
//  1. put(k on leaseholder n1), gateway chooses t=1.0
//  2. begin; read(unrelated key on n2); gateway chooses t=0.98
//  3. pick up observed timestamp for n2 of t=0.99
//  4. n1 transfers lease for range with k to n2 @ t=1.1
//  5. read(k) on leaseholder n2 at ReadTimestamp=0.98 should get
//     ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval because of the write in step 1, so
//     even though we observed n2's timestamp in step 3 we must expand
//     the uncertainty interval to the lease's start time, which is
//     guaranteed to be greater than any write which occurred under
//     the previous leaseholder.
