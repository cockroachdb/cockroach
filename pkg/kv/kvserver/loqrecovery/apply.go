		//
		// However, this is not guaranteed. For one, applying a command is not
		// synced to disk, so in theory whichever store becomes the designated
		// survivor may temporarily have "forgotten" that the transaction
		// committed in its applied state (it would still have the committed log
		// entry, as this is durable state, so it would come back once the node was
		// running, but we don't see that materialized state in `debug recover`).
		// This is unlikely to be a problem in practice, since we assume that the
		// store was shut down gracefully and besides, the write likely had plenty
		// of time to make it to durable storage. More troubling is the fact that
		// the designated survivor may simply not yet have learned that the
		// transaction committed; it may not have been in the quorum and could've
		// been slow to catch up on the log.  It may not even have the intent; in
		// theory the remaining replica could have missed any number of transactions
		// on the range descriptor (even if they are in the log, they may not yet be
		// applied, and the replica may not yet have learned that they are
		// committed). This is particularly troubling when we miss a split, as the
		// right-hand side of the split will exist in the meta ranges and could even
		// be able to make progress.  For yet another thing to worry about, note
		// that the determinism (across different nodes) assumed in this tool can
		// easily break down in similar ways (not all stores are going to have the
		// same view of what the descriptors are), and so multiple replicas of a
		// range may declare themselves the designated survivor. Long story short,
		// use of this tool with or without the presence of an intent can - in
		// theory - really tear the cluster apart.
		//
		// A solution to this would require a global view, where in a first step
		// we collect from each store in the cluster the replicas present and
		// compute from that a "recovery plan", i.e. set of replicas that will
		// form the recovered keyspace. We may then find that no such recovery
		// plan is trivially achievable, due to any of the above problems. But
		// in the common case, we do expect one to exist.
