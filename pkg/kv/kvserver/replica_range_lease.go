// This file contains replica methods related to range leases.
//
// Here be dragons: The lease system (especially for epoch-based
// leases) relies on multiple interlocking conditional puts (here and
// in NodeLiveness). Reads (to get expected values) and conditional
// puts have to happen in a certain order, leading to surprising
// dependencies at a distance (for example, there's a LeaseStatus
// object that gets plumbed most of the way through this file.
// LeaseStatus bundles the results of multiple checks with the time at
// which they were performed, so that timestamp must be used for later
// operations). The current arrangement is not perfect, and some
// opportunities for improvement appear, but any changes must be made
// very carefully.
//
// NOTE(bdarnell): The biggest problem with the current code is that
// with epoch-based leases, we may do two separate slow operations
// (IncrementEpoch/Heartbeat and RequestLease/AdminTransferLease). In
// the organization that was inherited from expiration-based leases,
// we prepare the arguments we're going to use for the lease
// operations before performing the liveness operations, and by the
// time the liveness operations complete those may be stale.
//
// Therefore, my suggested refactoring would be to move the liveness
// operations earlier in the process, soon after the initial
// leaseStatus call. If a liveness operation is required, do it and
// start over, with a fresh leaseStatus.
//
// This could also allow the liveness operations to be coalesced per
// node instead of having each range separately queue up redundant
// liveness operations. (The InitOrJoin model predates the
// singleflight package; could we simplify things by using it?)

// leaseStatus returns a lease status. The lease status is linked to the desire
// to serve a request at a specific timestamp (which may be a future timestamp)
// under the lease, as well as a notion of the current hlc time (now).
//
// Explanation
//
// A status of ERROR indicates a failure to determine the correct lease status,
// and should not occur under normal operations. The caller's only recourse is
// to give up or to retry.
//
// If the lease is expired according to the now timestamp (and, in the case of
// epoch-based leases, the liveness epoch), a status of EXPIRED is returned.
// Note that this ignores the timestamp of the request, which may well
// technically be eligible to be served under the lease. The key feature of an
// EXPIRED status is that it reflects that a new lease with a start timestamp
// greater than or equal to now can be acquired non-cooperatively.
//
// If the lease is not EXPIRED, the request timestamp is taken into account. The
// expiration timestamp is adjusted for clock offset; if the request timestamp
// falls into the so-called "stasis period" at the end of the lifetime of the
// lease, or if the request timestamp is beyond the end of the lifetime of the
// lease, the status is UNUSABLE. Callers typically want to react to an UNUSABLE
// lease status by extending the lease, if they are in a position to do so.
//
// For request timestamps falling before the lease's stasis period, the lease's
// start timestamp is checked against the minProposedTimestamp. This timestamp
// indicates the oldest timestamp that a lease can have as its start time and
// still be used by the node. It is set both in cooperative lease transfers and
// to prevent reuse of leases across node restarts (which would result in
// latching violations). Leases with start times preceding this timestamp are
// assigned a status of PROSCRIBED and can not be not be used. Instead, a new
// lease should be acquired by callers.
//
// Finally, for requests timestamps falling before the stasis period of a lease
// that is not EXPIRED and also not PROSCRIBED, the status is VALID.
//
// Implementation Note
//
// On the surface, it might seem like we could easily abandon the lease stasis
// concept in favor of consulting a request's uncertainty interval. We would
// then define a request's timestamp as the maximum of its read_timestamp and
// its global_uncertainty_limit, and simply check whether this timestamp falls
// below a lease's expiration. This could allow certain transactional requests
// to operate more closely to a lease's expiration. But not all requests that
// expect linearizability use an uncertainty interval (e.g. non-transactional
// requests), and so the lease stasis period serves as a kind of catch-all
// uncertainty interval for non-transactional and admin requests.
//
// Without that stasis period, the following linearizability violation could
// occur for two non-transactional requests operating on a single register
// during a lease change:
//
// * a range lease gets committed on the new lease holder (but not the old).
// * client proposes and commits a write on new lease holder (with a timestamp
//   just greater than the expiration of the old lease).
// * client tries to read what it wrote, but hits a slow coordinator (which
//   assigns a timestamp covered by the old lease).
// * the read is served by the old lease holder (which has not processed the
//   change in lease holdership).
// * the client fails to read their own write.

			//
			// 2. A lease is accepted for a Replica that has been removed. Without
			// precautions, this could happen because lease requests are special in
			// that they are the only command that is proposed on a follower (other
