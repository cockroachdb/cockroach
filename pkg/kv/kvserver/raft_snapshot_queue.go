	// this range. In particular, there can be many of them if merges apply in
	// rapid succession. The leftmost replica is the most important one to catch
	// up, as it will absorb all of the overlapping replicas when caught up past
	// all of the merges.

	// make sure that log truncations won't require snapshots for healthy
