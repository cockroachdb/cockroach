// TODO: This is an unusued implementation, it probably is only good as an
// idea, rather than a working implementation. See the objective and other
// commentary below.

// Objective: Know when a remote store is not likely to be able to shed any
// load, because its load delta haven't changed over the last t duration (in
// addition to tracking the last time the remote rebalancer ran). When
// this is the case, we can begin shedding load from the remote store to other
// stores. Presumably every other allocator would be doing the same.
//
// For a load update:
// (1) This allocator receives a store load msg for a store sX
// (2) This allocator then updates the store load tracker for sX using the load
// usage.
//
// For a rebalance:
// (1) When considering a rebalance for a remote store sX, this allocator
// checks whether the load delta of sX has decreased over the last t duration.
//
// (2) If the absolute load of sX has not decreased over the last t duration
// AND the remote rebalancer has run in the last t duration, then the
// remote store is not likely to be able to shed any load.
//
// Alternatively, we could also track the amount of load the remote store has
// shed locally. This would allow us to determine if the remote store is not likely
// to be able to shed any load as well.

// storeLoadTracker tracks the reported load of a store over time. It can be
// used to query the store load delta over time of a store in order to
// determine if the remote store is not likely to be able to shed any load.
