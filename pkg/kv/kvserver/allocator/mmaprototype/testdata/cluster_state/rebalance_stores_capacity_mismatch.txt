# Test scenario: Low capacity stores unable to take replicas from high capacity stores.
#
# This test demonstrates that stores with low capacities cannot accept replicas
# from stores with higher capacities, even when they have lower absolute load.
# The transfers fail due to the UTILIZATION override in loadSummaryForDimension(),
# not because the target would have higher load relative to the mean.
#
# Modeled after allocbench/nodes=7/cpu=8/kv/r=95/access=skew/lbr=mmc

# Try to rebalance from overloaded high capacity store to low capacity stores.
#
# Cluster means (from output below): cpu=541, capacity=714, utilization=75.8%
#
# Current utilization of stores:
# - s1: 900/1000 = 90%
# - s2: 900/1000 = 90%
# - s3: 900/1000 = 90%
# - s4: 300/500 = 60%
# - s5: 280/500 = 56%
# - s6: 260/500 = 52%
# - s7: 250/500 = 50%
#
# Lease transfers add delta of 180 CPU (range load 200 minus raft-cpu 20).
# Replica transfers add delta of 200 CPU (full range load since leaseholder moves too).
#
# Example: transferring r1 replica to s7 (from log lines 297-308):
# - s7 current load: 250
# - Delta: 200 (full range load including raft-cpu since leaseholder moves too)
# - With 1.1x safety margin: 200 * 1.1 = 220 (see loadMultiplierForAddition)
# - s7 load after transfer: 250 + 220 = 470
# - s7 new utilization: 470/500 = 94%
# - s1 load after transfer: 700
#
# KEY INSIGHT: The transfer fails due to UTILIZATION, not mean comparison.
#
# Mean comparison (fractionAbove = load/meanLoad - 1):
#   s7 after transfer: 470/541 - 1 = -0.13 → would be "loadLow" (< -0.1 threshold)
#
# But utilization override kicks in (see loadSummaryForDimension):
#   meanUtil*1.1 = 0.758*1.1 = 0.83 < fractionUsed (0.94)
#   Since fractionUsed >= 0.9 → overloadUrgent
#
# So even though s7 (470 CPU) would have LOWER absolute load than s1 (700 CPU)
# after the transfer, and lower load relative to the mean, the HIGH UTILIZATION
# (94%) triggers the utilization override, making s7 overloadUrgent.
