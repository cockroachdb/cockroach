# This test verifies lateral (within-node) replica transfers are allowed.
# Stores on the shedding store's node are NOT excluded as targets, allowing
# replica movement between stores on the same node.
#
# Setup:
# - n1s1: has replica, leaseholder, not overloaded
# - n2s2: has replica, not overloaded
# - n3s3: has replica, write-bandwidth overloaded (trying to shed)
# - n3s4: same node as s3, no replica, not overloaded - VALID lateral target
#
# Expected: s3 sheds its replica to s4 (lateral transfer within n3).

# s3 is overloaded. Since the lease is on s1 (not s3), s3 can only shed via
# replica transfer. s4 is on the same node (n3) and is a valid lateral target.
# TODO(during review): s4 actually gets rejected on the last mile because for
# some reason the "due to target_summary(overloadSlow)>=loadNoChange" fires;
# I need to piece this together but this doesn't seem right. We're on a low-CPU
# node and simply trying to move IO between two stores of the same node. This
# seems like an unambigiously good idea (if we can't move the load elsewhere).
