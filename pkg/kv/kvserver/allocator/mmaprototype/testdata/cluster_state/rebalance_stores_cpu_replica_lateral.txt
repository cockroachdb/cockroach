# This test verifies lateral (within-node) replica transfers are allowed.
# Stores on the shedding store's node are NOT excluded as targets, allowing
# replica movement between stores on the same node.
#
# Setup:
# - n1s1: has replica, leaseholder, not overloaded
# - n2s2: has replica, not overloaded
# - n3s3: has replica, write-bandwidth overloaded (trying to shed)
# - n3s4: same node as s3, no replica, not overloaded - VALID lateral target
#
# Expected: s3 sheds its replica to s4 (lateral transfer within n3).
