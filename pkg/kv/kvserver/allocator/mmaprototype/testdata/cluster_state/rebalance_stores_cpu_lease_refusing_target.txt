# This test verifies that the multi-metric allocator skips stores that aren't
# ready to receive leases when considering lease transfers.
#
# Setup: s1 holds the lease for r1, with replicas on s1, s2, s3.
# - s1: overloaded (wants to shed leases)
# - s2: low load (would be ideal target) but marked as refusing leases
# - s3: also overloaded (not a good target)
#
# Expected: s2 is filtered out. With only overloaded stores remaining,
# no lease transfer occurs.
