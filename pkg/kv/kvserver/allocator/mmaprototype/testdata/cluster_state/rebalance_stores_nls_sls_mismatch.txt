# Regression test for issue #160569: panic in sortTargetCandidateSetAndPick
# when sls <= loadNoChange but nls > loadNoChange.
#
# Setup: Node n1 has two stores:
# - s1: low CPU, moderate writes
# - s2: very high CPU, replica disposition set to "refusing" (excluded from candidate set)
# Node n2 has s3.
#
# When we try to shed from s1:
# - Store mean over {s1, s3} (excluding s2 due to disposition)
# - s1's store-level load relative to this mean is <= loadNoChange
# - But n1's node CPU (s1+s2) is high, making nls > loadNoChange
#
# Before fix: computeCandidatesForReplicaTransfer doesn't bail out when
# sls <= loadNoChange && nls > loadNoChange, then passes sls as loadThreshold
# to sortTargetCandidateSetAndPick which requires loadThreshold > loadNoChange.
