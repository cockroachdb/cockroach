// Interval represents a transaction's uncertainty interval.
//
// The GlobalLimit is the transaction's initial upper bound on the interval,
// which is computed by its coordinator when the transaction is initiated as the
// current local HLC time plus the maximum clock offset between any two nodes in
// the system. Assuming this maximum clock skew bound holds, this represents an
// upper bound on the HLC time of any node in the system at the instant that the
// transaction began.
//
// The LocalLimit is an optional tighter bound established through HLC clock
// observations on individual nodes in the system. These clock observations
// ("observed timestamps") can only be used to lower the local limit of an
// uncertainty interval when a transaction evaluates on the node from which the
// observation was taken.
//
// The local limit can reduce the uncertainty interval applied to most values on
// a range. This can lead to values that would otherwise be considered uncertain
// by the original global limit to be considered "certainly concurrent", and
// thus not causally related, with the transaction due to observed timestamps.
// However, the local limit does not operate on a value's version timestamp. It
// instead applies to a value's local timestamp, which is a recording of the
// local HLC clock on the leaseholder that originally wrote the value.
//
// Uncertainty intervals also apply to non-transactional requests that require
// strong consistency (single-key linearizability). These requests defer their
// timestamp allocation to the leaseholder of their (single) range. They then
// establish an uncertainty interval and perform any uncertainty restarts on the
// server.
//
// NOTE: LocalLimit can be empty if no observed timestamp has been captured on
// the local node. However, if it is set, it must be <= GlobalLimit.
