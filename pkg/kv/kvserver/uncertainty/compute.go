// ComputeInterval returns the provided request's uncertainty interval to be
// used when evaluating under the specified lease.
//
// If the function returns an empty Interval{} then the request should bypass
// all uncertainty checks.
//
// The computation uses observed timestamps gathered from the leaseholder's node
// to limit the interval's local uncertainty limit. This prevents unnecessary
// uncertainty restarts caused by reading a value written at a timestamp between
// txn.ReadTimestamp and txn.GlobalUncertaintyLimit.
//
// There is another case that impacts the use of the transactions observed
// timestamp.
//
// If both these conditions hold:
//   - A transaction already has an observed timestamp value for a node
//   - That node was not the leaseholder for some or all of the range as of the
//     time of the observed timestamp, but it is now.
//
// Then the transaction's observed timestamp is not (entirely) respected when
// computing a local uncertainty limit.
//
// As background, for efficiency reasons, observed timestamp tracking is done at
// a node level, but more precisely it refers to the ranges that node is the
// leaseholder for. This discrepancy is accounted for by the
// minValidObservedTimestamp parameter, and two specific cases are covered in
// more detail below.
//
// Here is the hazard that can occur without this field for a lease transfer.
//
//  1. put(k on leaseholder n1), gateway chooses t=1.0
//  2. begin; read(unrelated key on n2); gateway chooses t=0.98
//  3. pick up observed timestamp for n2 of t=0.99
//  4. n1 transfers lease for range with k to n2 @ t=1.1
//  5. read(k) on leaseholder n2 at ReadTimestamp=0.98 should get
//     ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval because of the write in step 1, so
//     even though we observed n2's timestamp in step 3 we must expand
//     the uncertainty interval to the lease's start time, which is
//     guaranteed to be greater than any write which occurred under
//     the previous leaseholder.
//
// A similar hazard applies to range merges.
//
//  1. put(k2 on n2, r2); gateway chooses t=1.0
//  2. begin; read(k on n1, r1); gateway chooses t=0.98
//  3. pick up observed timestamp for n1 of t=0.99
//  4. r1 merged right-hand neighbor r2 @ t=1.1
//  5. read(k2) on joint range at ReadTimestamp=0.98 should get
//     ReadWithinUncertaintyInterval because of the write in step 1, so
//     even though we observed n1's timestamp in step 3 we must expand
//     the uncertainty interval to the range merge freeze time, which
//     is guaranteed to be greater than any write which occurred on the
//     right-hand side.
