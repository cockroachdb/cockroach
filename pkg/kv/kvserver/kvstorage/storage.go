// The following are type aliases that help annotating various storage
// interaction functions in this package and its clients, accordingly to the
// logical type of the storage engine being used.
//
// From the perspective of this package, the storage engine is logically
// separated into state machine engine and raft engine. The raft engine contains
// raft state: mainly HardState, raft log, and RaftTruncatedState.
//
// The state machine engine contains mainly the replicated state machine (RSM)
// of all ranges hosted by the store, as well as the supporting unreplicated
// metadata of these ranges, such as RaftReplicaID and RangeTombstone.
//
// TODO(pav-kv): as of now, these types are transparently convertible to one
// another and storage package interfaces. It is possible to mis-use them
// without compilation errors. This is fine while separated storage is not
// supported, but we want to make type-checking stronger eventually.
