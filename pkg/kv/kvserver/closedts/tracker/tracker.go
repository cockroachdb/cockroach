// Tracker tracks the lower bound of a set of timestamps (called the tracked
// set). Timestamps can be added and removed from the tracked set. A
// conservative estimation of the set's lower bound can be queried; the result
// will be lower or equal to all the tracked timestamps; it might not be equal
// to the lowest timestamp currently in the set (i.e. it might not be precise).
//
// For context, the Tracker is used to track the write timestamps of requests
// currently evaluating on a range. The lower bound is used to figure out what
// timestamps can be closed: we can only close timestamps below that of any
// request that's currently evaluating. The Tracker itself does not know
// anything about closed timestamps.
//
// Track can be called concurrently. Other methods cannot be called concurrently
// (with themselves or with any other method, including Track).
//
// The usage pattern is:
//
// Start of request evaluation:
//
// externalLock.RLock()
// tok := Tracker.Track(request.writeTimestamp)
// externalLock.RUnlock()
//
// Proposal buffer flush:
//
// externalLock.Lock()
// for each command being proposed:
//
//	Tracker.Untrack(tok)
//
// newClosedTimestamp := min(now() - kv.closed_timestamp.target_duration, Tracker.LowerBound() - 1)
// externalLock.Unlock()
//
// The production implementation of the interface is the lockfreeTracker, which
// trades accuracy for performance. There's also a more pedestrian HeapTracker
// reference implementation.

	// cause an allocation (when the implementation's concrete token type is
	// wrapped in the RemovalToken interface). If their token implementation is
	// smaller or equal to a pointer size, the allocation will be avoided.
