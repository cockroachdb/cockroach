// An Entry is a closed timestamp update. It consists of a closed timestamp
// (i.e. a timestamp at or below which the origin node guarantees no more new
// writes are going to be permitted), an associated epoch in which the origin
// node promises it was live (for the closed timestamp), a map of minimum lease
// applied indexes (which have to be caught up to before being allowed to use
// the closed timestamp) as well as an indicator of whether this update supplies
// a full initial state or an increment to be merged into a previous state. In
// practice, the first Entry received for each epoch is full, while the remainder
// are incremental. An incremental update represents the implicit promise that
// the state accumulated since the last full Entry is the true full state.

  // entries, the recipient may behave as if the MLAI of 12 were repeated across
  // all of these entries.
