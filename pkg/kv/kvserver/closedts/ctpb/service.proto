// decided by the leaseholder replica of the range. The side transport sender
// periodically transmits closed timestamp updates for ranges it's responsible
// for, closing timestamps on a per-bucket basis.
//
// NB: The policy is only used inside kvserver, and shouldn't leak to the
// client. See roachpb.ClosedTimestampPolicy and toClientClosedTsPolicy for the
// client side equivalent.
//
// Closed timestamp policies on the server can be dynamically adjusted based on
// observed network latencies between the leaseholder and its farthest follower.
// Each range is bucketed based on observed network latencies, and buckets may
// change as network latencies change, or the range's SpanConfig changes.

// ranges are removed, and how the closed timestamps for different categories of
// ranges advanced. Ranges communicated by a previous message and not touched by
