// since the previous message (the previous message can be a snapshot or another
// incremental); they contain info about which new ranges are included in the
// info provided, which ranges are removed, and how the closed timestamps for
// different categories of ranges advanced. Ranges communicated by a previous
// message and not touched by an incremental are "implicitly" referenced by the
