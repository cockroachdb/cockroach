		//
		// "left" and "right" refers to how the timestamps at which the
		// associated command evaluations take place relate to `next`.
		// `left`-tracked proposals are taken into account for the next closed
		// timestamp, i.e. they could mutate at timestamps <= `next`. `right`
		// proposals affect only MVCC timestamps > `next` and thus will become

		// A replica wishing to serve a follower read will first have to catch
		// up to a lease applied index that is guaranteed to include all writes
		// affecting the closed timestamp or below. When `next` is closed out,
		// the set of relevant Lease Applied Indexes will be stored in `leftMLAI`.
		//
		// This is augmented by reference counts for the proposals currently in
		// the process of evaluating. `next` can only be closed out once
		// `leftRef` has been drained (i.e. has dropped to zero); new proposals
		// are always forced above `next` and consequently count towards
		// `rightRef`.
		//
		// Epochs track the highest liveness epoch observed for any released
		// proposals. Tracking a max epoch allows the MPT to provide some MLAI
		// information about the current epoch when calls to Close straddle multiple
		// different epochs. Before epoch tracking was added the client of the MPT
		// was forced to assume that the MLAI information from the current call to
		// Close corresponded to the highest known epoch as of the previous call to
		// Close. This is problematic in cases where an epoch change leads to a
		// lease change for an otherwise quiescent range. If this mechanism were
		// not in place then the client would never learn about an MLAI for the
		// current epoch. Clients provide their view of the current epoch to calls
		// to Close which use this information to determine whether the current
		// state should be moved and whether the caller can make use of the
		// currently tracked data. Each side tracks data which corresponds exactly
		// to the side's epoch value. Releasing a proposal into the tracker at a
		// later epoch than is currently tracked will result in the current data
		// corresponding to the prior epoch to be evicted.

// provided timestamp, and the timestamp previously passed to Close is returned
// as a closed timestamp along with a map of minimum Lease Applied Indexes
// reflecting the updates for the past period. On failure, the previous closed
// timestamp is returned along with a nil map (which can be treated by callers
// like a successful call that happens to not return any new information).
// Similarly, failure to provide a timestamp strictly larger than that to be
// closed out next results in the same "idempotent" return values.
//
// Callers additionally provide the current expected epoch value, the liveness
// epoch at which the caller intends to advertise this closed timestamp. The
// caller must know that it is live at a timestamp greater than or equal to the
// timestamp which the tracker will close. For correctness purposes this will
// be the case if the caller knows that it is live at next and calls to Close()
// pass monontic calues for next. If the current expected epoch is older than
// the currently tracked data then the timestamp will fail to be closed. If the
// expected epoch value is older than the epoch tracked on the left but
// corresponds to the epoch of the previous successful close then the previous
// closed timestamp is returned along with a nil map. This situation is just
// like the unsuccessful close scenario due to unreleased proposals. This
// behavior enables the caller to successfully obtain the tracked data at the
// newer epoch in a later query after its epoch has updated. If the caller's
// expected epoch is even older than the previously returned epoch then zero
// values are returned. If the caller's expected epoch is newer than that of
