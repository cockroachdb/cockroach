	// DisableRaftSnapshotQueue disables the raft snapshot queue. Use this
	// sparingly, as it tends to produce flaky tests during up-replication where
	// the explicit learner snapshot gets lost. Since uninitialized replicas
	// reject the raft leader's MsgApp with a rejection that hints at index zero,
	// Raft will always want to send another snapshot if it gets to talk to the
	// follower before it applied the snapshot. In the common case, the mechanism
	// we have to suppress raft snapshots while an explicit snapshot is in flight
	// avoids the duplication of work. However, in the uncommon case, the raft
	// leader is on a different store and so no suppression takes place. This
	// duplication is avoided by turning the raft snapshot queue off, but
	// unfortunately there are certain conditions under which the explicit
	// snapshot may fail to produce the desired result of an initialized follower
	// which the leader will append to.
	//
	// For example, if there is a term change between when the snapshot is
	// constructed and received, the follower will silently drop the snapshot
	// without signaling an error to the sender, i.e. the leader. (To work around
	// that, once could adjust the term for the message in that case in
	// `(*Replica).stepRaftGroup` to prevent the message from getting dropped).
	//
	// Another problem is that the snapshot may apply but fail to inform the
	// leader of this fact. Once a Raft leader has determined that a follower
	// needs a snapshot, it will keep asking for a snapshot to be sent until a) a
	// call to .ReportSnapshotStatus acks that a snapshot got applied, or b) an
	// MsgAppResp is received from from the follower acknowledging an index
	// *greater than or equal to the PendingSnapshotIndex* it tracks for that
	// follower (such an MsgAppResp is emitted in response to applying the
	// snapshot), whichever occurs first.
	//
	//
	// However, neither may happen despite the snapshot applying successfully. The
	// call to `ReportSnapshotStatus` may not occur on the correct Replica, since
	// Raft leader can change during replication operations, and MsgAppResp can
	// get dropped. Even if the MsgAppResp does get to the leader, the contained
	// index (which is the index of the snapshot that got applied) may be less
	// than the index at which the leader asked for a snapshot (since the applied
	// snapshot is an external snapshot, and may have been initiated before the
	// raft leader even wanted a snapshot) - again leaving the leader to continue
	// asking for a snapshot. Lastly, even if we improved the raft code to accept
	// all snapshots that allow it to continue replicating the log, there may have
	// been a log truncation separating the snapshot from the log.
	//
	// Either way, the result in all of the rare cases above this is that an
	// additional snapshot must be sent from the Raft snapshot queue until the
	// leader will include the follower in log replication. It is thus ill-advised
	// to turn the snap queue off except when this is known to be a good idea.
