// Subsume freezes a range for merging with its left-hand neighbor. When called
// correctly, it provides important guarantees that ensure there is no moment in
// time where the ranges involved in the merge could both process commands for
// the same keys.
//
// Specifically, the receiving replica guarantees that:
//
//  1. it is the leaseholder at the time the request executes,
//  2. when it responds, there are no commands in flight with a timestamp
//     greater than the FreezeStart timestamp provided in the response,
//  3. the MVCC statistics in the response reflect the latest writes,
//  4. it, and all future leaseholders for the range, will not process another
//     command until they refresh their range descriptor with a consistent read
//     from meta2, and
//  5. if it or any future leaseholder for the range finds that its range
//     descriptor has been deleted, it self destructs.
//
// To achieve guarantees four and five, when issuing a Subsume request, the
// caller must have a merge transaction open that has already placed deletion
// intents on both the local and meta2 copy of the right-hand range descriptor.
// The intent on the meta2 allows the leaseholder to block until the merge
// transaction completes by performing a consistent read for its meta2
// descriptor. The intent on the local descriptor allows future leaseholders to
// efficiently check whether a merge is in progress by performing a read of its
// local descriptor after acquiring the lease.
//
// The period of time after intents have been placed but before the merge
// transaction is complete is called the merge's "critical phase".
