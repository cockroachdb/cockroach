// splitStatsHelper codifies and explains the stats computations related to a
// split. The quantities known during a split (i.e. while the split trigger
// is evaluating) are
//
//   - AbsPreSplitBothStored: the stats of the range before the split trigger,
//     i.e. without accounting for any writes in the batch. This can have
//     ContainsEstimates set.
//   - DeltaBatchEstimated: the writes in the batch, i.e. the stats delta accrued
//     from the evaluation of the EndTxn so far (this is mostly the write to the
//     transaction record, as well as resolving the intent on the range descriptor,
//     but nothing in this code relies on that). Since we have no reason to
//     introduce ContainsEstimates in a split trigger, this typically has
//     ContainsEstimates unset, but the results will be estimate free either way.
//   - AbsPostSplit{Left,Right}: the stats of either the left or right hand side
//     range after applying the split, i.e. accounting both for the shrinking as
//     well as for the writes in DeltaBatch related to the shrunk keyrange. In
//     practice, we obtain this by recomputing the stats using the corresponding
//     AbsPostSplit{Left,Right}Fn, and so we don't expect ContainsEstimates to be
//     set in them. The choice of which side to scan is controlled by ScanRightFirst.
//   - DeltaRangeKey: the stats delta that must be added to the non-computed
//     half's stats to account for the splitting of range keys straddling the split
//     point. See computeSplitRangeKeyStatsDelta() for details.
//
// # We are interested in computing from this the quantities
//
//   - AbsPostSplitRight(): the stats of the right hand side created by the split,
//     i.e. the data taken over from the left hand side plus whatever was written to
//     the right hand side in the process (metadata etc). We can recompute this, but
//     try to avoid it unless necessary (when CombinedErrorDelta below is nonzero).
//   - DeltaPostSplitLeft(): the stats delta that should be emitted by the split
//     trigger itself, i.e. the data which the left hand side (initially comprising
//     both halves) loses by moving data into the right hand side (including whatever
//     DeltaBatch contained in contributions attributable to the keyspace on the
//     left).
//   - CombinedErrorDelta: the difference between (AbsPreSplitBoth+DeltaBatch) and
//     the recomputation of the pre-split range including the batch. This is zero if
//     neither of the inputs contains estimates. If it's not zero, we need to
//     recompute from scratch to obtain AbsPostSplitRight. What's interesting about
//     this quantity is that we never care what exactly it is, but we do care
//     whether it's zero or not because if it's zero we get to do less work.
//
// Moreover, we want both neither of AbsPostSplit{Right,Left} to end up with
// estimates. The way splits are set up right now, we sort of get this "for
// free" for the left hand side (since we recompute that unconditionally; there
// is a guarantee that the left hand side is never too large). We also don't
// want to create new ranges that start out with estimates (just to prevent the
// unbounded proliferation of estimates).
//
// The two unknown quantities can be expressed in terms of the known quantities
// because
//
// (1) AbsPreSplitBoth + DeltaBatch + DeltaRangeKey
//   - CombinedErrorDelta = AbsPostSplitLeft + AbsPostSplitRight
//
// In words, this corresponds to "all bytes are accounted for": from the initial
// stats that we have (accounting for the fact that AbsPreSplitBoth+DeltaBatch
// may contain estimates), everything we add/remove during the split ends up
// tracked either on the left and on the right, and nothing is created out of
// thin air.
//
// (2) AbsPreSplitBoth + DeltaPostSplitLeft() = AbsPostSplitLeft
//
// This expresses the fact that is always true whenever a command applies on a
// range without introducing an estimate: the stats before the command plus the
// delta emitted by the command equal the stats after the command. In this case,
// the stats before the command are that of the range before the split (remember
// that the split shrinks the range towards the start key, i.e. the left hand
// side is the same range as the pre-split one).
//
// These two equations are easily solved for the unknowns. First, we can express
// DeltaPostSplitLeft() in known quantities via (2) as
//
//	DeltaPostSplitLeft() = AbsPostSplitLeft - AbsPreSplitBothStored.
//
// Note that if we start out with estimates, DeltaPostSplitLeft() will wipe out
// those estimates when added to the absolute stats.
//
// For AbsPostSplitRight(), there are two cases. First, due to the identity
//
//	CombinedErrorDelta = AbsPreSplitBothStored + DeltaBatchEstimated
//	                     -(AbsPostSplitLeft + AbsPostSplitRight)
//	                     + DeltaRangeKey.
//
// and the fact that the second and third lines contain no estimates, we know
// that CombinedErrorDelta is zero if the first line contains no estimates.
// Using this, we can rearrange as
//
//	AbsPostSplitRight() = AbsPreSplitBoth + DeltaBatch - AbsPostSplitLeft
//	                      + DeltaRangeKey.
//
// where all quantities on the right are known. If CombinedErrorDelta is
// nonzero, we effectively have one more unknown in our linear system and we
// need to recompute AbsPostSplitRight from scratch. (As fallout, we can in
// principle compute CombinedError, but we don't care).
