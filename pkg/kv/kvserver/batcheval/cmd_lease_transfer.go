	// latches to synchronize with all other reads and writes on the outgoing
	// leaseholder. Additionally, it observes the state of the timestamp cache
	// and so it uses latches to wait for all in-flight requests to complete.
	//
	// Because of this, it declares a non-MVCC write over every addressable key
	// in the range, even though the only key the TransferLease actually writes
	// to is the RangeLeaseKey. This guarantees that it conflicts with any other
	// request because every request must declare at least one addressable key.
	//
	// We could, in principle, declare these latches as MVCC writes at the time
	// of the new lease. Doing so would block all concurrent writes but would
	// allow reads below the new lease timestamp through. However, doing so
	// would only be safe if we also accounted for clock uncertainty in all read
	// latches so that any read that may need to observe state on the new
	// leaseholder gets blocked. We actually already do this for transactional
	// reads (see DefaultDeclareIsolatedKeys), but not for non-transactional
	// reads. We'd need to be careful here, so we should only pull on this if we

	// We perform this action during evaluation to ensure that the lease
	// revocation takes place regardless of whether the corresponding Raft
	// proposal succeeds, fails, or is ambiguous - in which case there's no

	// to give the lease to someone else, so we'll have to re-acquire the lease
	// again through a RequestLease request to recover. This situation is tested
	// in TestBehaviorDuringLeaseTransfer/transferSucceeds=false.
