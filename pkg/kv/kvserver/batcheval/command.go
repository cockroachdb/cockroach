// The quintessential example of a property of a Range that is not immutable is
// its end key. It would be incorrect to declare keys between a Range's start
// key and its current end key as a means of latching the entire range, because
// a merge of a right-hand neighbor could complete in between the time that a
// request declares its keys and the time that it evaluates. This could lead to
// a violation of the mutual exclusion that the command was expecting to have.
