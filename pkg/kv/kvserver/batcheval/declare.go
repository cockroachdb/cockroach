		// It is critical that reads declare latches up through their uncertainty
		// interval so that they are properly synchronized with earlier writes that
		// may have a happened-before relationship with the read. These writes could
		// not have completed and returned to the client until they were durable in
		// the Range's Raft log. However, they may not have been applied to the
		// replica's state machine by the time the write was acknowledged, because
		// Raft entry application occurs asynchronously with respect to the writer
		// (see AckCommittedEntriesBeforeApplication). Latching is the only
		// mechanism that ensures that any observers of the write wait for the write
		// apply before reading.
		//
		// NOTE: we pass an empty lease status here, which means that observed
		// timestamps collected by transactions will not be used. The actual
		// uncertainty interval used by the request may be smaller (i.e. contain a
		// local limit), but we can't determine that until after we have declared
