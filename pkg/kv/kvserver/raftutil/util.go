	// 1. a log truncation cuts the peer replica off from the log, preventing it

	//    cutting any follower off from connectivity with the leader's log, but
	//    there are cases where it does so.
	// 2. raft leadership is transferred to a replica whose log does not extend
	//    back as far as the current raft leader's log. This is possible because
	//    different replicas can have Raft logs with different starting points
	//    ("first indexes"). See discussion about #35701 in #81561.

	//    goes into effect. In practice, this means serializing with Raft log
	//    truncation operations using latching.
