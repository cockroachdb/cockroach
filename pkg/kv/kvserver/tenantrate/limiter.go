// Limiter is used to rate-limit KV requests for a given tenant.
//
// The use of an interface permits a different implementation for the system
// tenant and other tenants. The remaining commentary will pertain to the
// implementation used for non-system tenants. The limiter is implemented as
// a multi-dimensional token-bucket. The dimensions are Requests, WriteBytes,
// and ReadBytes. Each dimension has a rate and burst limit per tenant. These
// limits are controlled via cluster settings.
//
// Calls to Wait interact with all three dimensions. The Wait call takes a
// quantity of writeBytes which it attempts to consume from the Limiter. It also
// attempts to consume 1 request and 1 readByte. This readByte "courtesy"
// allocation is used in conjunction with the RecordRead method to control the
// rate of reads despite not knowing how much data a request will read a priori.
// If a request attempts to consume more than the burst limit in any dimension,
// it can proceed only if the token bucket is completely full in that dimension.
// In that case, the acquisition will put the Limiter into debt in that
// dimension, meaning that its current quota is negative. Future acquisitions
// will need to wait until the debt is paid off. Calls to RecordRead subtract
// the indicated byte quantity from the token bucket regardless of its current
// value. RecordRead can push the limiter into debt, blocking future requests
// until that debt is paid.
//
// The Limiter is backed by a FIFO queue which provides fairness.
