	// A transaction is committing with a commit trigger. This means that it has
	// side-effects beyond those of the intents that it has written.
	//
	// If the transaction has a commit timestamp in the future of present time, it
	// will need to commit-wait before acknowledging the client. Typically, this
	// is performed in the TxnCoordSender after the transaction has committed and
	// resolved its intents (see TxnCoordSender.maybeCommitWait). It is safe to
	// wait after a future-time transaction has committed and resolved intents
	// without compromising linearizability because the uncertainty interval of
	// concurrent and later readers ensures atomic visibility of the effects of
	// the transaction. In other words, all of the transaction's intents will
	// become visible and will remain visible at once, which is sometimes called
	// "monotonic reads". This is true even if the resolved intents are at a high
	// enough timestamp such that they are not visible to concurrent readers
	// immediately after they are resolved, but only become visible sometime
	// during the writer's commit-wait sleep. This property is central to the
	// correctness of non-blocking transactions. See:
	//   https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20200811_non_blocking_txns.md
	//
	// However, if a transaction has a commit trigger, the side-effects of the
	// trigger will go into effect immediately after the EndTxn's Raft command is
	// applied to the Raft state machine. This poses a problem, because we do not
	// want part of a transaction's effects (e.g. its commit trigger) to become
	// visible to onlookers before the rest of its effects do (e.g. its intent
	// writes). To avoid this problem, we perform the commit-wait stage of a
	// transaction with a commit trigger early, before its commit triggers fire.
	// This results in the transaction waiting longer to commit and resolve its
	// intents, but is otherwise safe and effective.
	//
	// NOTE: it would be easier to perform this wait during the evaluation of the
	// corresponding EndTxn request instead of detecting the case here. However,
	// we intentionally do not commit wait during evaluation because we do not
	// want to sleep while holding latches and blocking other requests. So
	// instead, we commit wait here and then assert that transactions with commit
	// triggers do not need to commit wait further by the time they reach command
	// evaluation.

// caller. However, it does not need to. Instead, it can assume responsibility
// for releasing the concurrency guard it was provided by returning nil. This is
// useful is cases where the function:
//  1. eagerly released the concurrency guard after it determined that isolation
//     from conflicting requests was no longer needed.
//  2. is continuing to execute asynchronously and needs to maintain isolation
//     from conflicting requests throughout the lifetime of its asynchronous
//     processing. The most prominent example of asynchronous processing is
//     with requests that have the "async consensus" flag set. A more subtle
//     case is with requests that are acknowledged by the Raft machinery after
//     their Raft entry has been committed but before it has been applied to
//     the replicated state machine. In all of these cases, responsibility
//     for releasing the concurrency guard is handed to Raft.
//
// However, this option is not permitted if the function returns a "server-side

// the function returns one of these errors, it must also pass ownership of the

		// adjust its timestamp and retry on the server.
		//
		// This is similar to other server-side retries that we allow below
		// latching, like for WriteTooOld errors. However, because uncertainty
		// errors are specific to non-locking reads, they can not [2] be retried
		// without first dropping and re-acquiring their read latches at a higher
		// timestamp. This is unfortunate for uncertainty errors, as it leads to
		// some extra work.
		//
		// On the other hand, it is more important for other forms of retry errors
		// to be handled without dropping latches because they could be starved by
		// repeated conflicts. For instance, if WriteTooOld errors caused a write
		// request to drop and re-acquire latches, it is possible that the request
		// could return after each retry to find a new WriteTooOld conflict, never
		// managing to complete. This is not the case for uncertainty errors, which
		// can not occur indefinitely. A request (transactional or otherwise) has a
		// fixed uncertainty window and, once exhausted, will never hit an
		// uncertainty error again.
		//
		// [1] if a locking read observes a write at a later timestamp, it returns a

		// However, if we hit an intent during a follower read, the lock-table will
		// be disabled, so we won't be able to use it to wait for the resolution of
		// the intent. Instead of waiting locally, we replace the WriteIntentError
		// with an InvalidLeaseError so that the request will be redirected to the
		// leaseholder. Beyond implementation constraints, waiting for conflicting
		// intents on the leaseholder instead of on a follower is preferable
		// because:
		// - the leaseholder is notified of and reactive to lock-table state
		//   transitions.
		// - the leaseholder is able to more efficiently resolve intents, if
		//   necessary, without the risk of multiple follower<->leaseholder
		//   round-trips compounding. If the follower was to attempt to resolve
		//   multiple intents during a follower read then the PushTxn and
		//   ResolveIntent requests would quickly be more expensive (in terms of
		//   latency) than simply redirecting the entire read request to the
		//   leaseholder and letting the leaseholder coordinate the intent
		//   resolution.
		// - after the leaseholder has received a response from a ResolveIntent
		//   request, it has a guarantee that the intent resolution has been applied
		//   locally and that no future read will observe the intent. This is not
		//   true on follower replicas. Due to the asynchronous nature of Raft, both
		//   due to quorum voting and due to async commit acknowledgement from
		//   leaders to followers, it is possible for a ResolveIntent request to
		//   complete and then for a future read on a follower to observe the
		//   pre-resolution state of the intent. This effect is transient and will
		//   eventually disappear once the follower catches up on its Raft log, but
		//   it creates an opportunity for momentary thrashing if a follower read
		//   was to resolve an intent and then immediately attempt to read again.
		//
		// This behavior of redirecting follower read attempts to the leaseholder
		// replica if they encounter conflicting intents on a follower means that
		// follower read eligibility is a function of the "resolved timestamp" over
		// a read's key span, and not just the "closed timestamp" over its key span.
		// Architecturally, this is consistent with Google Spanner, who maintains a
		// concept of "safe time", "paxos safe time", "transaction manager safe
		// time". "safe time" is analogous to the "resolved timestamp" in
		// CockroachDB and "paxos safe time" is analogous to the "closed timestamp"
		// in CockroachDB. In Spanner, it is the "safe time" of a replica that
