	// A transaction is committing with a commit trigger. This means that it has
	// side-effects beyond those of the intents that it has written.
	//
	// If the transaction has a commit timestamp in the future of present time, it
	// will need to commit-wait before acknowledging the client. Typically, this
	// is performed in the TxnCoordSender after the transaction has committed and
	// resolved its intents (see TxnCoordSender.maybeCommitWait). It is safe to
	// wait after a future-time transaction has committed and resolved intents
	// without compromising linearizability because the uncertainty interval of
	// concurrent and later readers ensures atomic visibility of the effects of
	// the transaction. In other words, all of the transaction's intents will
	// become visible and will remain visible at once, which is sometimes called
	// "monotonic reads". This is true even if the resolved intents are at a high
	// enough timestamp such that they are not visible to concurrent readers
	// immediately after they are resolved, but only become visible sometime
	// during the writer's commit-wait sleep. This property is central to the
	// correctness of non-blocking transactions. See:
	//   https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20200811_non_blocking_txns.md
	//
	// However, if a transaction has a commit trigger, the side-effects of the
	// trigger will go into effect immediately after the EndTxn's Raft command is
	// applied to the Raft state machine. This poses a problem, because we do not
	// want part of a transaction's effects (e.g. its commit trigger) to become
	// visible to onlookers before the rest of its effects do (e.g. its intent
	// writes). To avoid this problem, we perform the commit-wait stage of a
	// transaction with a commit trigger early, before its commit triggers fire.
	// This results in the transaction waiting longer to commit and resolve its
	// intents, but is otherwise safe and effective.
	//
	// NOTE: it would be easier to perform this wait during the evaluation of the
	// corresponding EndTxn request instead of detecting the case here. However,
	// we intentionally do not commit wait during evaluation because we do not
	// want to sleep while holding latches and blocking other requests. So
	// instead, we commit wait here and then assert that transactions with commit
	// triggers do not need to commit wait further by the time they reach command
	// evaluation.
	//

// caller. However, it does not need to. Instead, it can assume responsibility
// for releasing the concurrency guard it was provided by returning nil. This is
// useful is cases where the function:

//    from conflicting requests was no longer needed.
// 2. is continuing to execute asynchronously and needs to maintain isolation

//    with requests that have the "async consensus" flag set. A more subtle
//    case is with requests that are acknowledged by the Raft machinery after
//    their Raft entry has been committed but before it has been applied to
//    the replicated state machine. In all of these cases, responsibility
//    for releasing the concurrency guard is handed to Raft.
//
// However, this option is not permitted if the function returns a "server-side
// concurrency retry error" (see isConcurrencyRetryError for more details). If
// the function returns one of these errors, it must also pass ownership of the
