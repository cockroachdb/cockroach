// removePreemptiveSnapshot is a migration put in place during the 20.1 release
// to remove any on-disk preemptive snapshots which may still be resident on a
// 19.2 node's store due to a rapid upgrade.
//
// As of 19.2, a range can never process commands while it is not part of a
// range. It is still possible that on-disk replica state exists which does not
// contain this Store exist from when this store was running 19.1 and was not
// removed during 19.2. For the sake of this method and elsewhere we'll define
// a preemptive snapshot as on-disk data corresponding to an initialized range
// which has a range descriptor which does not contain this store.
//
// In 19.1 when a Replica processes a command which removes it from the range
// it does not immediately destroy its data. In fact it just assumed that it
// would not be getting more commands appended to its log. In some cases a
// Replica would continue to apply commands even while it was not a part of the
// range. This was unfortunate as it is not possible to uphold certain invariants
// for stores which are not a part of a range when it processes a command. Not
// only did the above behavior of processing commands regardless of whether the
// current store was in the range wasn't just happenstance, it was a fundamental
// property that was relied upon for the change replicas protocol. In 19.2 we
// adopt learner Replicas which are added to the raft group as a non-voting
// member before receiving a snapshot of the state. In all previous versions
// we did not have voters. The legacy protocol instead relied on sending a
// snapshot of raft state and then the Replica had to apply log entries up to
// the point where it was added to the range.
