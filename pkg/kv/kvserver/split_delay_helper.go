		// If we're not a follower nor a leader, there are elections going on.
		// Wait until these have concluded (at which point we'll either be

		// progress). This is an important step for preventing cascading
		// issues when a range is split rapidly in ascending order (i.e.
		// each split splits the right hand side resulting from the prior
		// split). Without this code, the split delay helper may end up
		// returning early for each split in the following sequence:
		//
		// - r1=[a,z) has members [s1, s2]
		// - r1 splits into r1=[a,b) and r2=[b,z)
		// - s1 applies the split, r2@s1 reaches out to r2@s2 (MsgApp)
		// - r2@s2 (not initialized yet) drops the MsgApp thanks to `maybeDropMsgApp`
		// - r2@s1 marks r2@s1 as probing, will only contact again in 1s
		// - r2 splits again into r2=[b,c), r3=[c,z)
		// - r2@s1 applies the split, r3@s1 reaches out to r3@s2 (which is not initialized)
		// - r3@s2 drops MsgApp due to `maybeDropMsgApp`
		// - r3@s1 marks r3@s2 as probing, will only contact again in 1s
		// - ...
		// - r24@s1 splits into r25=[x,y) and r26=[y,z)
		// - r24@s1 reaches out to r24@s2 (not inited and drops MsgApp)
		//
		// Note that every step here except the fourth one is almost guaranteed.
		// Once an MsgApp has been dropped, the next split is also going to have
		// the same behavior, since the dropped MsgApp prevents the next split
		// from applying on that follower in a timely manner. The issue thus
		// becomes self-sustaining.
		//
		// At some point during this cascade, s2 will likely apply the first split
		// trigger on its replica of r1=[a,z), which will initialize r2@s2. However,
		// since r2@s1 has already marked r2@s2 as probing, it won't contact it, on
		// average, for another 500ms. When it does, it will append the next split to
		// the log which can then be applied, but then there is another ~500ms wait
		// until r3@s2 will be caught up by r3@s1 to learn about the next split. This
		// means that on average, split N is delayed by ~N*500ms. `maybeDropMsgApp` on
		// deeply nested ranges on s2 will eventually give up and this will lead to,
		// roughly, snapshots being requested across most of the ranges, but none
		// of these snapshots can apply because the keyspace is always occupied by
		// one of the descendants of the initial range (however far the splits have
		// made it on s2). On top of log spam and wasted work, this prevents the
		// Raft snapshot queue from doing useful work that may also be necessary.
		//
		// The main contribution of the helper to avoiding this cascade is to wait
		// for the replicas of the right-hand side to be initialized. This breaks
		// the above history because a split will only commence once all prior
		// splits in the chain have applied on all members.
		//
		// See TestSplitBurstWithSlowFollower for end-to-end verification of this
		// mechanism.
