// A rangefeed's "resolved timestamp" is defined as the timestamp at which no
// future updates will be emitted to the feed at or before. The timestamp is
// monotonically increasing and is communicated through RangeFeedCheckpoint
// notifications whenever it changes.
//
// The resolved timestamp is closely tied to a Range's closed timestamp, but
// these concepts are not the same. Fundamentally, a closed timestamp is a
// property of a Range that restricts its state such that no "visible" data
// mutations are permitted at equal or earlier timestamps. This enables the
// guarantee that if the closed timestamp conditions are met, a follower replica
// has all state necessary to satisfy reads at or before the CT. On the other
// hand, a resolved timestamp is a property of a rangefeed that restrict its
// state such that no value notifications will be emitted at equal or earlier
// timestamps. The key difference here is that data mutations are allowed on a
// Range beneath a closed timestamp as long as they are not externally
// "visible". This is not true of the resolved timestamp because a rangefeed is
// driven directly off the state of a Range through its Raft log updates. As
// such, all changes to a Range beneath a given timestamp that will end up
// published on a rangefeed, "visible" or not, must be made to the Range before
// its resolved timestamp can be advanced to that timestamp.
//
// This distinction becomes interesting when considering how committed
// transaction intents are published as rangefeed events. Because the rangefeed
// is driven off the Raft log, these events are published when the intents are
// resolved, not when their corresponding transactions are committed. This leads
// to an important case with unresolved intents where a Range's closed timestamp
// and its corresponding rangefeed's resolved timestamp diverge because the
// closed timestamp advances past the timestamp of the unresolved intents. This
// is permitted because intent resolution of an intent which is part of a
// committed or aborted transaction does not change the visible state of a
// range. In effect, this means that a range can "close" timestamp t2 before
// resolving an intent for a transaction at timestamp t1, where t1 < t2.
// However, the rangefeed cannot "resolve" timestamp t2 until after the event
// for the committed intent is published. This creates a scenario where the
// Range's closed timestamp could have advanced to t2 while the corresponding
// rangefeed's resolved timestamp lags behind at some time earlier than t1,
// waiting for the intent resolution to result in a rangefeed publication.
//
// It follows that the closed timestamp mechanism is a necessary, but not
// sufficient, solution to creating a resolved timstamp. The closed timestamp is
// a necessary basis for the resolved timestamp because without it there could
// never be any guarantee about new changes to a range. However, the closed
// timestamp is not sufficient and could not replace the resolved timestamp
// directly because it does not wait for all changes to result in rangefeed
// notifications before advancing. In order to provide the proper guarantees for
// the resolved timestamp, it must be computed as the minimum of the closed
// timestamp and the timestamp of the earliest "unresolved intent" (see below)
// in the rangefeed's corresponding range of keys. This relies on one implicit
// assumption that is important enough to state: the closed timestamp must
// ensure that no unresolved intents will appear at timestamps that it has
// already closed off. Naively this property will hold, but it requires that
// changes to the closed timestamp and the tracking of unresolved intents be
// handled carefully and in a total order.

		//     evicting the transaction from the queue for good.
		//
		//     Just like any other transaction, this new intent will necessarily
		//     be pushed above the closed timestamp, so we don't need to worry
		//     about resolved timestamp regressions.
		//
		// - MVCCUpdateIntentOp: it could update one of its intents. If we're
		//     not already tracking the transaction then the queue will ignore
		//     the intent update.
		//
		// - MVCCAbortIntentOp: it could resolve one of its intents as aborted.

//  1. part of a PENDING transaction
