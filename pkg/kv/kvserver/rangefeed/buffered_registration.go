// bufferedRegistration is an instance of a rangefeed subscriber who has
// registered to receive updates for a specific range of keys. It buffers live
// raft updates in buf and has a dedicated goroutine runOutputLoop responsible
// for volleying events to underlying Stream after catch up scan is done. Events
// from catch up scans are directly sent to underlying Stream.
//
// Updates are delivered to its stream until one of the following conditions is
// met:
// 1. a Send to the Stream returns an error
// 2. the Stream's context is canceled
// 3. the registration is manually unregistered
//
// In all cases, when a registration is unregistered its error
// channel is sent an error to inform it that the registration
// has finished.
