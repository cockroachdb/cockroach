//    - COMMITTED: launch async processes to resolve the transaction's intents
//                 so they will be resolved sometime soon and unblock the
//                 resolved timestamp.
//    - ABORTED:   inform the Processor to stop caring about the transaction.
//                 It will never commit and its intents can be safely ignored.
