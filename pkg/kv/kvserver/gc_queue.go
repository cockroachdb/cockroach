// makeGCQueueScoreImpl is used to compute when to trigger the GC Queue. It's
// important that we don't queue a replica before a relevant amount of data is
// actually deletable, or the queue might run in a tight loop. To this end, we
// use a base score with the right interplay between GCByteAge and TTL and
// additionally weigh it so that GC is delayed when a large proportion of the
// data in the replica is live. Additionally, returned scores are slightly
// perturbed to avoid groups of replicas becoming eligible for GC at the same
// time repeatedly.
//
// More details below.
//
// When a key of size `B` is deleted at timestamp `T` or superseded by a newer
// version, it henceforth is accounted for in the range's `GCBytesAge`. At time
// `S`, its contribution to age will be `B*seconds(S-T)`. The aggregate
// `GCBytesAge` of all deleted versions in the cluster is what the GC queue at
// the time of writing bases its `shouldQueue` method on.
//
// If a replica is queued to have its old values garbage collected, its contents
// are scanned. However, the values which are deleted follow a criterion that
// isn't immediately connected to `GCBytesAge`: We (basically) delete everything
// that's older than the Replica's `TTLSeconds`.
//
// Thus, it's not obvious that garbage collection has the effect of reducing the
// metric that we use to consider the replica for the next GC cycle, and it
// seems that we messed it up.
//
// The previous metric used for queueing: `GCBytesAge/(1<<20 * ttl)` does not
// have the right scaling. For example, consider that a value of size `1mb` is
// overwritten with a newer version. After `ttl` seconds, it contributes `1mb`
// to `GCBytesAge`, and so the replica has a score of `1`, i.e. (roughly) the
// range becomes interesting to the GC queue. When GC runs, it will delete value
// that are `ttl` old, which our value is. But a Replica is ~64mb, so picture
// that you have 64mb of key-value data all at the same timestamp, and they
// become superseded. Already after `ttl/64`, the metric becomes 1, but they
// keys won't be GC'able for another (63*ttl)/64. Thus, GC will run "all the
// time" long before it can actually have an effect.
//
// The metric with correct scaling must thus take into account the size of the
// range. What size exactly? Any data that isn't live (i.e. isn't readable by a
// scan from the far future). That's `KeyBytes + ms.ValBytes - ms.LiveBytes`,
// which is also known as `GCBytes` in the code. Hence, the better metric is
// `GCBytesAge/(ttl*GCBytes)`.
//
// Using this metric guarantees that after truncation, `GCBytesAge` is at most
// `ttl*GCBytes` (where `GCBytes` has been updated), i.e. the new metric is at
// most 1.
//
// To visualize this, picture a rectangular frame of width `ttl` and height
// `GCBytes` (i.e. the horizontal dimension is time, the vertical one bytes),
// where the right boundary of the frame corresponds to age zero. Each non-live
// key is a domino aligned with the right side of the frame, its height equal to
// its size, and its width given by the duration (in seconds) it's been
// non-live.
//
// The combined surface of the dominos is then `GCBytesAge`, and the claim is
// that if the total sum of domino heights (i.e. sizes) is `GCBytes`, and the
// surface is larger than `ttl*GCBytes` by some positive `X`, then after
// removing the dominos that cross the line `x=-ttl` (i.e. `ttl` to the left
// from the right side of the frame), at least a surface area of `X` has been
// removed.
//
//               x=-ttl                 GCBytes=1+4
//                 |           3 (age)
//                 |          +-------+
//                 |          | keep  | 1 (bytes)
//                 |          +-------+
//            +-----------------------+
//            |                       |
//            |        remove         | 3 (bytes)
//            |                       |
//            +-----------------------+
//                 |   7 (age)
//
// This is true because
//
// deletable area  = total area       - nondeletable area
//                 = X + ttl*GCBytes  - nondeletable area
//                >= X + ttl*GCBytes  - ttl*(bytes in nondeletable area)
//                 = X + ttl*(GCBytes - bytes in nondeletable area)
//                >= X.
//
// Or, in other words, you can only hope to put `ttl*GCBytes` of area in the
// "safe" rectangle. Once you've done that, everything else you put is going to
// be deleted.
//
// This means that running GC will always result in a `GCBytesAge` of `<=
// ttl*GCBytes`, and that a decent trigger for GC is a multiple of
// `ttl*GCBytes`.
