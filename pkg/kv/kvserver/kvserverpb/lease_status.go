// ClosedTimestampUpperBound represents the highest timestamp that can be closed

// We can't close timestamps above the current lease's expiration. This is in
// order to keep the monotonic property of closed timestamps carried by
// commands, which makes for straight-forward closed timestamp management on the
// command application side: if we allowed requests to close timestamps above
// the lease's expiration, then a future LeaseRequest proposed by another node
// might carry a lower closed timestamp (i.e. the lease start time).
//
// Note that the stasis period doesn't affect closed timestamps; a request is
// only server under a particular closed timestamp if its read frontier is below
// the closed timestamp.
//
// We don't want to close timestamps within the same nanosecond as the lease
// expiration. If we did that, writes could not be processed under the current
// lease any more after such a close, and that would be a bit tricky to handle,
// particularly when the close time is in the future. To avoid having to deal
// with it, we leave one nanosecond (i.e. infinite logical time) in the lease.
// Until a new lease is acquired, all writes will be pushed into this last
// nanosecond of the lease.
