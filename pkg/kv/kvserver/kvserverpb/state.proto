  // versions for those are being rolled out cluster-wide, the expectation is
  // that all replica versions are bumped along side it. For everything else,
  // the coupling is neither necessary nor enforced. When a new replica is being
  // initialized, it's annotated with a replica version. This happens in one of
  // two places:
  // - during cluster creation time, in which case we source the binary version
  //   (i.e. the version the cluster is bootstrapped with)
  // - replicas created through snapshots or splits, where we inherit the
  //   version from the incoming snapshot or the LHS of the split respectively.
  //
  // While a below-raft migration is underway, replicas from different ranges
  // may have differing replica versions. This is fine, we rely on higher level
