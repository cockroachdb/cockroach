  // nodes were already using the RangeAppliedState key, or receiving messages

  //  - Removing this field in 22.1 meant it was set as false when received at
  //    21.2 nodes.
  //  - This should've been fine! We weren't using this field to trigger any
  //    upgrade code paths (like it was originally intended for).
  //  - It turns out that in 21.2 we were using the ReplicaState from the
  //    incoming snapshot to update our in-memory replica state
  //  - Because the proto field was being phased out, there was now a divergence
  //    between the on-disk state (field set to true, from earlier 21.2
  //    operations) and the in-memory state (field set to false, because sent
  //    from a version that attempted to get rid of this field).
  //
  // Removing proto fields from the replica state are not possible until we stop
  // using the protobuf copy of the replica state when applying a snapshot
  // (#72222). Once that's done, we should be able to stop sending the replica
  // state as part of the snapshot in the subsequent release.

  // state representation prior to, or after the change (in our example it
  // tells us whether or not we can assume an unreplicated truncated state). All
  // migrations associated with versions less than or equal to this one, can be
  // assumed to have run.
  //
  // We should note that the progression of cluster versions in the cluster does
  // not happen in lock step with replica versions for all replicas in the
  // system. Well, not for all cluster versions. Replica versions are one the
  // primitives used to coordinate below-raft migrations, and when cluster
  // versions for those are being rolled out cluster-wide, the expectation is
  // that all replica versions are bumped along side it. For everything else,
  // the coupling is neither necessary nor enforced. When a new replica is being
  // initialized, it's annotated with a replica version. This happens in one of
  // two places:
  // - during cluster creation time, in which case we source the binary version
