  // ERROR indicates that the lease can't be used or acquired. The state is
  // not a definitive indication of the lease's validity. Rather, it is an
  // indication that the validity is indeterminate; it may be valid or it
  // may not be.
  //
  // The ERROR state is returned in the following cases:
  // 1. An epoch lease has a reference to a node liveness record which the
  //    lease status evaluator is not aware of. This can happen when gossip
  //    is down and node liveness information is not available for the lease
  //    holder. In such cases, it would be unsafe to use the lease because
  //    the evaluator cannot determine the lease's expiration, so it may
  //    have expired. However, it would also be unsafe to replace the lease,
  //    because it may still be valid.
  // 2. A leader lease is evaluated on a replica that is not the raft leader
  //    and is not aware of a successor raft leader at a future term (either
  //    itself or some other replica). In such cases, the lease may be valid
  //    or it may have expired. The raft leader (+leaseholder) itself would
  //    be able to tell, but the only way for a follower replica to tell is
  //    for it to try to become the raft leader, while respecting raft
  //    fortification rules. In the meantime, it is best for the follower
  //    replica to redirect any requests to the raft leader (+leaseholder).
  ERROR = 0;
  // VALID indicates that the lease is not expired at the current clock
  // time and can be used to serve a given request.
  VALID = 1;
  // UNUSABLE indicates that a lease has not expired at the current clock
  // time, but cannot be used to serve a given request. A lease may be
  // unusable for one of two reasons.
  //
  // First, if the request operates at a timestamp in the future, it is
  // possible for the request's timestamp to fall outside of the lease's
  // validity window, even if the lease is not yet expired at the current
  // clock time. In such cases, the lease must be extended past the
  // request's timestamp before the request can be served under the lease.
  //
  // Second, even if the request does not operate at a timestamp in the
  // future and operates fully within the lease's validity window, it may
  // operate at a time too close to the lease's expiration to be served
  // safely due to clock uncertainty. We refer to the period at the end of
  // each lease, immediately before its expiration, as its stasis period.
  //
  // The point of the stasis period is to prevent reads on the old
  // leaseholder (the one whose stasis we're talking about) from missing
  // to see writes performed under the next lease (held by someone else)
  // when these writes should fall in the uncertainty window. Even without
  // the stasis, writes performed by the new leaseholder are guaranteed to
  // have higher timestamps than any reads served by the old leaseholder.
  // However, a read at timestamp T needs to observe all writes at
  // timestamps [T, T+maxOffset] and so, without the stasis, only the new
  // leaseholder might have some of these writes. In other words, without
  // the stasis, a new leaseholder with a fast clock could start
  // performing writes ordered in real time before the old leaseholder
  // considers its lease to have expired.
  //
  // An UNUSABLE lease may become VALID for the same leaseholder after a
  // successful RequestLease (for expiration-based leases) or Heartbeat
  // (for epoch-based leases), each of which serve as forms of "lease
  // extension".
  UNUSABLE = 2;
  // EXPIRED indicates that the current clock time is past the lease's
  // expiration time. An expired lease may become VALID for the same
  // leaseholder on RequestLease or Heartbeat, or it may be replaced by a
  // new leaseholder with a RequestLease (for expiration-based leases) or
  // IncrementEpoch+RequestLease (for epoch-based leases).

  // Only an EXPIRED lease may change hands non-cooperatively.

  // PROSCRIBED indicates that the lease's proposed timestamp is earlier
  // than allowed and can't be used to serve a request. This is used to
  // detect node restarts: a node that has restarted will see its former
  // incarnation's leases as PROSCRIBED so it will renew them before using
  // them. This state also used during a lease transfer, to prevent the
  // outgoing leaseholder from serving any other requests under its old
