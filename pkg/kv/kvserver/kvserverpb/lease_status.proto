  // UNUSABLE indicates that a lease has not expired at the present time
  // (i.e. it is VALID), but cannot be used to serve a given request. A
  // lease may be unusable for one of two reason.
  //
  // First, if the request operates at a timestamp in the future, it is
  // possible for the request's timestamp to fall outside of the lease's
  // validity window, even if the lease is valid at the present time. In
  // such cases, the lease must be extended past the request's timestamp
  // before the request can be served under the lease.
  //
  // Second, even if the request does not operate at a timestamp in the
  // future and operates fully within the lease's validity window, it may
  // operate at a time too close to the lease's expiration to be served
  // safely due to clock uncertainty. We refer to the period at the end of
  // each lease, immediately before its expiration, as its stasis period.
  //
  // The point of the stasis period is to prevent reads on the old
  // leaseholder (the one whose stasis we're talking about) from missing
  // to see writes performed under the next lease (held by someone else)
  // when these writes should fall in the uncertainty window. Even without
  // the stasis, writes performed by the new leaseholder are guaranteed to
  // have higher timestamps than any reads served by the old leaseholder.
  // However, a read at timestamp T needs to observe all writes at
  // timestamps [T, T+maxOffset] and so, without the stasis, only the new
  // leaseholder might have some of these writes. In other words, without
  // the stasis, a new leaseholder with a fast clock could start
  // performing writes ordered in real time before the old leaseholder
  // considers its lease to have expired.
  //
  // An UNUSABLE lease may become VALID for the same leaseholder after a
  // successful RequestLease (for expiration-based leases) or Heartbeat
  // (for epoch-based leases), each of which serve as forms of "lease
  // extension".

  // expiration-based leases) or IncrementEpoch+RequestLease (for
  // epoch-based leases).

  // PROSCRIBED indicates that the lease's proposed timestamp is earlier
  // than allowed and can't be used to serve a request. This is used to
  // detect node restarts: a node that has restarted will see its former
  // incarnation's leases as PROSCRIBED so it will renew them before using
  // them. Note that the PROSCRIBED state is only visible to the
  // leaseholder; other nodes will see this as a VALID lease.
