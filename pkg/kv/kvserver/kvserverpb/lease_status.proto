  VALID = 1;
  // UNUSABLE indicates that a lease has not expired at the current clock
  // time, but cannot be used to serve a given request. A lease may be
  // unusable for one of two reasons.
  //
  // First, if the request operates at a timestamp in the future, it is
  // possible for the request's timestamp to fall outside of the lease's
  // validity window, even if the lease is not yet expired at the current
  // clock time. In such cases, the lease must be extended past the
  // request's timestamp before the request can be served under the lease.
  //
  // Second, even if the request does not operate at a timestamp in the
  // future and operates fully within the lease's validity window, it may
  // operate at a time too close to the lease's expiration to be served
  // safely due to clock uncertainty. We refer to the period at the end of
  // each lease, immediately before its expiration, as its stasis period.
  //
  // The point of the stasis period is to prevent reads on the old
  // leaseholder (the one whose stasis we're talking about) from missing
  // to see writes performed under the next lease (held by someone else)
  // when these writes should fall in the uncertainty window. Even without
  // the stasis, writes performed by the new leaseholder are guaranteed to
  // have higher timestamps than any reads served by the old leaseholder.
  // However, a read at timestamp T needs to observe all writes at
  // timestamps [T, T+maxOffset] and so, without the stasis, only the new
  // leaseholder might have some of these writes. In other words, without
  // the stasis, a new leaseholder with a fast clock could start
  // performing writes ordered in real time before the old leaseholder
  // considers its lease to have expired.
  //
  // An UNUSABLE lease may become VALID for the same leaseholder after a
  // successful RequestLease (for expiration-based leases) or Heartbeat
  // (for epoch-based leases), each of which serve as forms of "lease
  // extension".
  UNUSABLE = 2;
  // EXPIRED indicates that the current clock time is past the lease's
  // expiration time. An expired lease may become VALID for the same

  // new leaseholder with a RequestLease (for expiration-based leases) or
  // IncrementEpoch+RequestLease (for epoch-based leases).
  //
  // Only an EXPIRED lease may change hands non-cooperatively.
  EXPIRED = 3;
  // PROSCRIBED indicates that the lease's proposed timestamp is earlier
  // than allowed and can't be used to serve a request. This is used to
  // detect node restarts: a node that has restarted will see its former
  // incarnation's leases as PROSCRIBED so it will renew them before using
  // them. This state also used during a lease transfer, to prevent the
  // outgoing leaseholder from serving any other requests under its old
  // lease. Note that the PROSCRIBED state is only visible to the
  // leaseholder; other nodes may see this as a VALID lease.

  // When evaluating lease status at a non-leaseholder there must only be one
  // descriptor in this list. This is for two reasons. First, if the dme-lease
  // is found to be EXPIRED, we need to have the specific descriptor under
  // which it was expired, and be certain that the descriptor applied (since
  // the later descriptors may never apply, and so their generation can get
  // reused). This is needed to correctly propose a new lease, whether it is
  // dme-based or not. Second, regardless of whether the previous lease was
  // dme-based or not, if the new lease is dme-based, we need to populate a
  // descriptor in the lease proposal.
  //
  // This field is only used if the existing lease is dme-based or the new
  // lease proposal using this status is dme-based.
