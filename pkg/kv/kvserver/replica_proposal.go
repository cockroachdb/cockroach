// ProposalData is data about a command which allows it to be
// evaluated, proposed to raft, and for the result of the command to
// be returned to the caller.
//
// A proposal (=ProposalData) is created during write request evaluation and
// then handed to the proposal buffer (Replica.mu.proposalBuf) via
// propBuf.Insert. In the common case, the proposal transfers from there into
// Replica.mu.proposals (and the raft log) via propBuf.FlushLockedWithRaftGroup
// (called from handleRaftReady). But if the proposal buffer is full, Insert may
// also flush the buffer to make room for a new proposal.

// `proposalBuf`, or `FlushLockedWithoutProposing` (less interesting).
// [3]: picked up by `(*replicaDecoder).retrieveLocalProposals` when the entry
// comes up for application. This atomically removes from r.my.proposals and
// sets the `seenDuringApplication` field, which prevents situations in which
// the proposal may otherwise re-enter the proposal buffer and from there the
// proposals map, despite already having finished. (The exact mechanism drops
// the proposal when it would otherwise be flushed into the map since that is
// more reliable, but the diagram omits this detail).
// [4]: if not being observed in log application for some time,
// `refreshProposalsLocked` re-submits to the proposal buffer, which will result
// in an (identical) copy of the proposal being added to the log. (All but the
// first copy that will be applied will not be associated with a proposal).
// [5]: if the entry applies under an already-consumed LeaseAppliedIndex,
// tryReproposeWithNewLeaseIndex creates a *new* proposal (which inherits the
// waiting caller, latches, etc) and the cycle begins again whereas the current
// proposal results in an error (which nobody is listening to).

// The access rules for this field are as follows:
//   - if the proposal has not yet been passed successfully to Replica.propose,
//     can access freely on the originating goroutine.
//   - otherwise, once the proposal has been seen in `retrieveLocalProposals`
//     and removed from r.mu.proposals, can access freely under raftMu.
//   - otherwise, must hold r.mu across the access.
//
// This reflects the lifecycle of the proposal, which enters first the proposal
// buffer (guarded by r.mu) and then is flushed into the proposals map, from
// which it is consumed during log application (which holds raftMu).
