TODO: Robust token return guarantee

We want a model like the following, given we there is buffering in raftTransport.raftSendQueue
that we want to utilize when processing Ready. That is, if the grpc-stream is transiently
down (say for 50ms), and there are send tokens available, we want to subtract tokens
and add to the raftSendQueue. If the grpc-stream reconnects those buffers will
get drained.
If that stream breaks, we will get TransportDisconnected to early return tokens.


                            (c) deducted here
                                 |
                                 v
<grpc-stream does not exist> <grpc-stream exists> <stream breaks>

  ^                                               ^
  |                                               |
                                                (b) and (c) tokens returned
tokens deducted here
added to raftTransport.raftSendQueue
(a) queue overflows (will transition to StateProbe and return tokens)
(b) did not overflow

We probably need to change the wire protocol to make this possible.

One other issue is that we can deduct tokens for the same index multiple
times, due to transitions out and into StateReplicate, each of which will
first cause early-return.
e.g.
  deduct send-tokens for index 10
  early-return index 10 tokens due to transition to StateSnapshot/StateProbe
  transition to StateReplicate and indexToSend < 10
  deduct send-tokens for index 10

After the second deduction, say there is no stream breakage or transition to
StateProbe. Which means the remote store will receive index 10. We need to ensure
it will call AdmitRaftEntry. Currently, that call happens in handRaftReadyRaftMuLocked,
using raftpb.MsgStorageAppend. This seems risky. If for some reason the remote store
has already appended an index >= 10, when it receives this MsgApp with index
10, this MsgApp will not pop out in handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked.

If we instead called AdmitRaftEntry in Replica.stepRaftGroup, it may be
sufficient
to fix this problem.

/*
Design for robust flow token return in RACv2

RACv1 has a lot of fragile moving parts for token return in the presence of
gRPC stream disconnects. It also is over-eager in early-returning tokens at
the sender, since it has to interpret the gRPC stream disconnect as the worst
case of tokens being lost. With RACv2 we have more requirements, due to the
repeated deduction of send-tokens for the same entry, which make the fragility
even worse (and we will need to make code changes to the already fragile
code). See
https://cockroachlabs.slack.com/archives/C06UFBJ743F/p1717076603877549 for a
long discussion with details.

Since we now control the Raft code, we have the opportunity to change Raft and
eliminate the existing fragility.

As part of this design, we reduce the number of priorities used in flow
control. We only have two token pools (elastic and regular work-class) with
all priorities < NormalPri mapping to elastic, which limits the performance
isolation guarantee we can make between different priorities that map to
regular work-class. There is still value in having more than two priorities
since on the receiving store we can better distinguish different priority
regular work on different ranges, whose leaders are on different nodes.
Reducing the number of priorities simplifies tracking data-structures both in
RACv2 (the counts of entries at each priority can be an array and not a map)
and in Raft.

The new priorities are:
pri < NormalPri : flowLowPri
NormalPri <= pri < LockingNormalPri : flowNormalPri
LockingNormalPri <= pri < UserHighPri : intent resolution typically flowAboveNormalPri
UserHighPri <= pri: flowHighPri

And numFlowPri is flowHighPri+1. 4 priorities will add 4 uint64's to the wire
protocol and data-structures. With varint encoding, the wire protocol cost
should not be significant.

Raft knows nothing about flow tokens, i.e., how admission is accomplished. But
it does track what has been admitted, and ensures liveness of this tracking.

Raft state at leader for each follower in StateReplicate:
match uint64, next uint64, admitted [numFlowPri]uint64
Invariants:
- (existing) match < next
- (new) for all i: admitted[i] <= match: That is, something cannot be admitted
   unless it is also persisted (this is slightly stronger than ACv1, but solves
   the OOM problem too).

Additional condition for pinging with MsgApps (which happen when match+1 <
next) and for not quiescing (which additionally requires match is equal to
lastEntryIndex):
- exists i: admitted[i] < match

When a follower transitions to StateReplicate, admitted[i] is initialized to
match, for all i.

Advancing Raft state at leader for the follower:

MsgAppResp currently contains Message.Index which becomes the new Match.
Additionally, it will contain Admitted [numFlowPri]uint64. This is the latest
index up to which admission has happened. That is, this is not incremental
state, and just the latest state (which makes it easy to tolerate lossiness). It
will be used to advance admitted at the leader.

MsgApp from the leader contains the latest admitted[i] values it has, so that
the follower doesn't bother with a MsgAppResp if the states are the same at
the leader and the follower.

Raft state at all replicas:

Existing state includes stableIndex, lastEntryIndex (I am not using the right
Raft package terms, and there could be other mistakes here)

- stableIndex is advanced based on MsgStorageAppendResp
- lastEntryIndex is advanced in RawNode.Step. This happens before Ready handling in kvserver.

- for async storage writes (which we enable in Raft): the MsgStorageAppend
  includes Responses to deliver when the write is done. These responses include
  both MsgStorageAppendResp for the local node (this is delivered when the
  raftScheduler processes this range again), and
  MsgAppResp for the leader, when the node is a follower (which is sent immediately).
  - This early creation of MsgAppResp, before the entries to append are
    persisted, is reasonable since that persistence is atomic for all the
    entries in MsgStorageAppend. In comparison, admission of the various entries
    in MsgStorageAppend is not atomic, which justifies the different behavior
    sketched below.

New raft state at all replicas regarding what they have admitted: admitted [numFlowPri]uint64
Invariant: for all i: admitted[i] <= stableIndex.

Raft constructs MsgAppResp for (a) MsgApp pings, (b) for use when
MsgStorageAppend has persisted. These will piggyback the latest admitted
values known to it.

Additionally, RaftInterface.AdvanceAdmitted(admitted [numFlowPri]uint64) will
be called by kvserver in handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked. And if advanced, this
method will return a MsgAppResp to be sent.

Life of admission:
- (kvserver) Leader proposes by calling RawNode.Step with MsgProp.
- (kvserver) Leader Ready processing:
  - Raft produces MsgStorageAppend for leader. This includes MsgStorageAppendResp
    to send to the leader when the append is done.
  - MsgApp for followers, constructed by RAC once send tokens are available:
    - RAC deducts flow tokens corresponding to MsgApp it asks for by
      calling RaftInterface.MakeMsgApp. This also advances Next.
    - Raft constructs its own pinging MsgApps
    Both kinds include Admitted, representing the leader's current knowledge.

- MsgApp processing at follower:
  - (kvserver) calls RawNode.Step with the MsgApps. lastEntryIndex is advanced.
  - (kvserver) handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked. Ready may contain:
     - MsgAppResp: this will be sent.
     - [MSA] MsgStorageAppend: Processing:
       - async storage writes: The MsgStorageAppend includes Responses which
         contain both MsgStorageAppendResp for the local node (this is delivered
         after the write completes and when the raftScheduler processes this
         range again), and MsgAppResp which are sent when the write completes,
         without waiting for the raftScheduler (to minimize commit latency).
       - calls AdmitRaftEntry for the entries in raftpb.MsgStorageAppend. In
         addition to queueing in the StoreWorkQueue, this will track (on the
         Replica): notAdmitted [numFlowPri][]uint64, where the []uint64 is in
         increasing entry index order. We don't bother with the term in the
         tracking (unlike the RaftLogPosition struct in the current code). These
         slices are appended to here, based on the entries in MsgStorageAppend.

- (kvserver) Admission happens on follower:
  - [AH1] The structs corresponding to the admitted entries are queued in the
    Replica akin to how we queue Replica.localMsgs and the raftScheduler will be
    told to do ready processing (there may not be a Raft ready, but this is akin
    to how handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked does
    deliverLocalRaftMsgsRaftMuLockedReplicaMuLocked).
  - [AH2] In handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked, this queue is used to remove things from
    notAdmitted. Additionally RaftInterface is queried for stableIndex. If a
    notAdmitted[i] is empty, admitted[i] = stableIndex, else admitted[i] =
    notAdmitted[i][0]-1. RaftInterface.AdvanceAdmitted is called, which may
    return a MsgAppResp.
  - MsgAppResp is sent.

MSA is also the behavior at the leader (which is just another replica that
must also advance Admitted for itself), which happens synchronously in the
handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked which handles the MsgStorageAppend.

AH1 and AH2 can happen synchronously when the entry is immediately admitted
during the handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked that called AdmitRaftEntry. These
entries are not stable yet, so we won't be able to advance admitted, but
when MsgStorageAppendResp is processed, that will be advanced.

Optimization:

I don't think we can afford to construct a RaftMessageRequest containing a
single MsgAppResp just to advance admitted. A RaftMessageRequest includes
ReplicaDescriptors etc. that make it heavyweight.

RACv1 optimizes this by having
kvflowcontrolpb.AdmittedRaftLogEntries(range-id, pri, upto-raft-log-position,
store-id) and piggy-backing these on any RaftMessageRequest being sent to the
relevant node. It didn't matter that the RaftMessageRequest was for a different
range.

We will do a similar piggy-backing:

- Say m is the raftpb.Message corresponding to the MsgAppResp that was
  returned from RaftInterface.AdvanceAdmitted
- Wrap it with the RangeID, and enqueue it for the leader's nodeid in the
  RaftTransport (this will actually be much simpler than the
  current RaftTransport.kvflowControl plumbing).
- Every RaftMessageRequest for the node will piggy-back these.

Priority inheritance:

See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qf6uteFRlbScLdWIrTfqgbrKRHfUsoMGatRLWYQgAi8/edit#bookmark=id.69inkdboirw0
for the high-level design.

Since the admitted[i] value for every priority advances up to stableIndex
based on the absence of entries with that priority waiting for admission
(unlike RACv1 advancement), there is no risk that a difference in belief in
the priority of index j at the leader and the follower will result in
permanent leakage of tokens corresponding to index j. Eventually admitted[i]
for all priorities i will advance to j.

We observe that the probability of priority mismatch is very low. The leader
when sending index j must be sending it for the first time since the
transition of this follower to StateReplicate, and given the ordered gRPC
stream used for communication, the likelihood that an old MsgApp containing
index j is received after whatever was needed to transition into
StateReplicate is very unlikely:

- if the follower was in StateProbe and transitioned to StateReplicate with a
  next index k < j, then k must have been lost, and the follower will discard
  everything until it sees index k again. This means any old j that was not lost
  will also be discarded.

- if the follower was in StateSnapshot and transitioned to StateReplicate with
  a next index k < j, then j must have never been sent earlier, since there was
  an index < k that had been truncated from the log.

Say such mismatch does happen. We consider two cases, via an example,
involving raft entry at index 3.

Case A: leader sent as low pri (elastic) and follower sees high pri (regular)

We will represent this as (3, L) at leader and (3, H) at follower.

Say the follower saw (2, L) and has not admitted it yet. But it admits (3, H).
It will have Admitted[H]=4, Admitted[L]=1. So the elastic tokens for 3 will
not be returned to the leader even though 3 has been admitted. This is
considered ok since the overload is severe enough to not yet admit (2, L), so
better not to return elastic tokens for (3, L).

Say the follower saw (4, L) and has admitted it but not yet admitted (3, H).
This could cause Admitted[H]=2, Admitted[L]=4, causing elastic tokens to be
returned for 3 before it has been admitted. This can't actually happen since
for the same raft group, (3, H) will be admitted before (4, L).

Case B: leader sent as high pri (regular) and follower sees low pri (elastic)

Say the follower admitted (2, H). So Admitted[H] >= 3. Even though (3, L) is
still waiting to be admitted, the regular tokens for 3 at the leader will be
returned. This is desirable since it is possible (3, H) would also have been
admitted, and it is better to be optimistic for regular work since it
corresponds to user facing work.

//   We will make C configurable, eventually.

// TODO(sumeer): kvflowcontrol and the packages it contains are sliced and
// diced quite fine, with the benefit of multiple code iterations to get to
// that final structure. We don't yet have that benefit, so we just lump
// things together for now, until most of the code is written and we know how
// to abstract into packages. There are things here that don't belong in
// kvflowconnectedstream, especially all the interfaces.

// TODO(sumeer): many of the comments here are to guide the implementation.
// They will need to be cleaned up.

// TODO(sumeer): Incorporate the following comment somewhere: we don't want
// force-flush entries to usually use up tokens since we don't want logical AC
// on the other side since it could cause an OOM. Also, a force-flush on range
// r1 to s3 because of a lack of quorum could consume all the tokens for s3
// that are needed by range r2 -- this is not a problem by itself since we are
// not trying to do inter-range isolation.
//
// In ACv1, when a node rejoins, we send it entries saying they are subject to
// AC, but don't track them on the sender, so they will logically queue. So
// that OOM possibility is real -- we just haven't seen it happen.

// A RangeController exists when a local replica of the range is the raft
// leader. It does not have a goroutine of its own and reacts to events. No
// mutex inside RangeController should be ordered before Replica.raftMu (or
// Replica.mu), since most event notifications happen with Replica.raftMu
// already held. We consider the following events:
//
// - RaftEvent: This happens on the raftScheduler and already holds raftMu, so
//   the RangeController can be sure that any questions it asks of
//   RaftInterface are consistent with RaftEvent. A RaftEvent encompasses a
//   combination of a tick and ready -- it is possible that there is no
//   "Ready". We assume that as long as not all replicas are caught up,
//   RaftEvents are guaranteed to happen at some minimum frequency (e.g. the
//   500ms of COCKROACH_RAFT_TICK_INTERVAL).
//
// - ControllerSchedulerEvent: This happens on the raftScheduler and
//   represents some work that the RangeController had scheduled. The Replica
//   will acquire raftMu before calling into RangeController. Such events are
//   used to dequeue raft entries from the send-queue when tokens are
//   available, or to force-flush.
//
// - SetReplicas: raftMu is already held (Replica.mu also happens to be held,
//   so SetReplicas should do a minimal amount of work). This ensures
//   RaftEvent and SetReplicas are serialized and the latest set of replicas
//   provided by SetReplicas is also what Raft is operating with. We will back
//   this with a data-structure under Replica.raftMu (and Replica.mu) that is
//   updated in setDescLockedRaftMuLocked. This consistency is important for
//   multiple reasons, including knowing which replicas to use when calling
//   the various methods in RaftInterface (i.e., it isn't only needed for
//   quorum calculation as discussed on the thread
//   https://cockroachlabs.slack.com/archives/C06UFBJ743F/p1715692063606459?thread_ts=1715641995.372289&cid=C06UFBJ743F)
//
// - SetLeaseholder: This is not synchronized with raftMu. The callee should
//   be prepared to handle the case where the leaseholder is not even a known
//   replica, but will eventually be known. TODO: The comment may be incorrect.
//
// ======================================================================
// Aside on consistency of RangeDescriptor in Replica and the raft group conf:
//
// - handleDescResult and replicaStateMachine.maybeApplyConfChange both happen
// in ApplySideEffects which is called with raftMu held.
//
// - snapshot: processRaftSnapshotRequest is both calling RawNode.Step and
// then handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked while holding raftMu, and the latter
// updates the desc and the former the raft group conf.
//
// - init after restart: initRaftMuLockedReplicaMuLocked does both
// initialization of the raft group and that of the descriptor.
//
// Since we are relying on this consistency, we should better document it.
// ======================================================================
// Buffering and delayed transition to StateProbe:
// Replica.addUnreachableRemoteReplica causes that transition, and is caused by
// a drop in Replica.sendRaftMessageRequest. But since the
// RaftTransport has a queue, it should not be get filled up due to a very
// transient connection break and reestablishment. This is good since transitions
// to StateProbe can result in force flush of some other replica.
//
// But a single MsgApp drop will also cause a transition to StateProbe, and
// that risk of force flush needs to be mitigated.
// ======================================================================
// Reproposal handling: We no longer do any special handling of reproposals.
