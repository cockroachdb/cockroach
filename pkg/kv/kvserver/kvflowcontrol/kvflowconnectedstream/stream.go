// TODO(sumeer): go through all recent slack threads and ensure they are
// incorporated.
// TODO(sumeer): undo random things.

// TODO: kvflowcontrol and the packages it contains are sliced and diced quite
// fine, with the benefit of multiple code iterations to get to that final
// structure. We don't yet have that benefit, so we just lump things together
// for now, until most of the code is written and we know how to abstract into
// packages. There are things here that don't belong in kvflowconnectedstream,
// especially all the interfaces.

// TODO: many of the comments here are to guide the implementation. They will
// need to be cleaned up.

// A RangeController exists when a local replica of the range is the raft
// leader. It does not have a goroutine of its own and reacts to events. No
// mutex inside RangeController should be ordered before Replica.raftMu, since
// some event notifications happen with Replica.raftMu already held. We
// consider the following events:
//
// - RaftEvent: This happens on the raftScheduler and already holds raftMu, so
//   the RangeController can be sure that any questions it asks of
//   RaftInterface are consistent with RaftEvent. A RaftEvent encompasses a
//   combination of a tick and ready -- it is possible that there is no
//   "Ready". We assume that as long as not all replicas are caught up,
//   RaftEvents are guaranteed to happen at some minimum frequency (e.g. the
//   500ms of COCKROACH_RAFT_TICK_INTERVAL).
//
// - ControllerSchedulerEvent: This happens on the raftScheduler and
//   represents some work that the RangeController had scheduled. If the
//   RangeController needs to call into RaftInterface, it must itself acquire
//   raftMu before doing so. Such events are used to dequeue raft entries from
//   the send-queue when tokens are available, or to force-flush.
//
// - SetReplicas: raftMu is already held. This ensures RaftEvent and
//   SetReplicas are serialized and the latest set of replicas provided by
//   SetReplicas is also what Raft is operating with. We will back this with a
//   data-structure under Replica.raftMu that is updated in
//   setDescLockedRaftMuLocked. This consistency is important for multiple
//   reasons, including knowing which replicas to use when calling the various
//   methods in RaftInterface (i.e., it isn't only needed for quorum
//   calculaton as discussed on the slack thread
//   https://cockroachlabs.slack.com/archives/C06UFBJ743F/p1715692063606459?thread_ts=1715641995.372289&cid=C06UFBJ743F)
//
// - SetLeaseholder: This is not synchronized with raftMu. The callee should
//   be prepared to handle the case where the leaseholder is not even a known
//   replica, but will eventually be known. TODO: The comment may be incorrect.
//
// - ReplicaDisconnected: raftMu is already held. Informs that a replica has
//   its RaftTransport disconnected. This is necessary to prevent lossiness of
//   tokens. The aforementioned map under Replica.raftMu will be used to
//   ensure consistency.
//
//   Connection events are not communicated. The current state of connectivity
//   should be requested from RaftInterface when handling RaftEvent (in case
//   there are some disconnected replicas that have reconnected), SetReplicas
//   (to see if a new replica is connected). So we rely on liveness of
//   RaftEvent to notice reconnections.
//
// ======================================================================
// Aside on consistency of RangeDescriptor in Replica and the raft group conf:
//
// - handleDescResult and replicaStateMachine.maybeApplyConfChange both happen
// in ApplySideEffects which is called with raftMu held.
//
// - snapshot: processRaftSnapshotRequest is both calling RawNode.Step and
// then handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked while holding raftMu, and the latter
// updates the desc and the former the raft group conf.
//
// - init after restart: initRaftMuLockedReplicaMuLocked does both
// initialization of the raft group and that of the descriptor.
//
// Since we are relying on this consistency, we should better document it
// ======================================================================
// Buffering and delayed transition to StateProbe:
// Replica.addUnreachableRemoteReplica causes that transition, and is caused by
// a drop in Replica.sendRaftMessageRequest. But since the
// RaftTransport has a queue, it should not be get filled up due to a very
// transient connection break and reestablishment. This is good since transitions
// to StateProbe can result in force flush of some other replica.
// ======================================================================
// Reproposal handling: We will no longer do any special handling of reproposals.
// v1 was accounting before an entry emerged in Ready, so there was a higher chance
// of lossiness (it may never emerge). With v2, there is lossiness too, but less,
// and since both the proposal and reproposal are going to be persisted in the raft
// log we count them both.
