  //   using 8 bits for the priority (we're using an int8 in Go code) and the
  //   remaining bits for the create timestamp with lower resolution.
  // - For AdmissionOriginNodeID, we could re-work the MultiRaft streaming RPCs
  //   to include upfront, during stream setup, which node the subsequent
  //   RaftMessageRequests are coming from. But this awkward to do with our
  //   current code layering:
  //   - We want to find out on a per raftpb.Entry level where it came from, and
  //     to do it once raft.Ready() tells to persist said entry into our raft log.
  //   - We're currently encoding this data in the raft entry itself, at the
  //     sender, so it's easy to decode at the right place in
  //     raft-ready-handling loop.
  //   - But if we had to "stitch in" the origin node ID once received off of
  //     the transport, or tie together raft entries with their origin node IDs
  //     through some other way (the raft library only wants to "step" through
  //     message type we can't so easily annotate), we'd have to do a fair bit
  //     of state tracking.
  // If it's still too costly, we could rip all this out and coarsen
  // intra-tenant ordering with respect to Admission{Priority,CreateTime}. We
  // could instead introduce a WorkQueue-like ordering at the origin where
  // requests wait for flow tokens for every <tenant,destination-store> it
  // intends to write to. Below raft we could live with just side-loaded
  // proposals being marked as admissionpb.BulkNormalPri. Origin-side ordering
  // would work ok for epoch-LIFO. The coarseness comes from this re-ordering
  // only happening on individual origin nodes.
  //
  // TODO(irfansharif): Get rid of this TODO block after simple performance
  // benchmarks (say, `cockroach workload run kv` with high concurrency and
  // small write sizes). The ideas above are too complicated.
