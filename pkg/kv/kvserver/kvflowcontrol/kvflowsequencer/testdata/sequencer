# Walk through the basics of how the per-handle sequencer works. The
# log-position= parameter is not actually used in the implementation, but in
# typical usage we'd be sequencing work in log position order, and it's
# instructive to understand how sequencing timestamps are generated.

#    static create-times).

# If the log index is incremented, so does the sequence number. So we're
# issuing "create times" that are higher than ones issued before for lower log
# indexes.

# Bump the log index by 19, and observe a higher sequence number. Since the
# create-time is static (0ms now and earlier), and we try to stay as close to
# the max observed create-time as possible, we increment the sequence number by
# the smallest possible amount -- 1ns.

# Regressions in log indexes (indicating buggy usage) doesn't cause regressions
# in the sequence number. As before, we simply issue monotonically increasing
# timestamps. With such buggy use, at worst we'd be over-admitting work when
# releasing tokens for higher log positions but lower sequencing timestamps.
