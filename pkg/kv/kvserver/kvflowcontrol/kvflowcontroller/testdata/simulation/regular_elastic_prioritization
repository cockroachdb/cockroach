# Observe that the elastic tokens deplete faster than regular tokens, since
# regular work deducts from both but elastic work only deducts from the elastic
# bucket. Elastic tokens are allowed to go into the negative through regular
# work deductions, when deducting regular tokens for the "top half" of the
# bucket (8MiB to 16MiB), we unilaterally deduct elastic tokens as well. The
# amount by which we go into debt is what was already deducted by elastic work
# by that point. See TestFlowTokenAdjustment for more details.

# they're deducted by both regular and elastic work, compared to regular tokens
