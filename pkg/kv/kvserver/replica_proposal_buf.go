// The proposal buffer also handles the assignment of maximum lease indexes for

// with determining the order in which they are inserted into the buffer to
// ensure that lease indexes are not assigned in a different order from that in
// which commands are proposed (and thus likely applied). If this order was to
// get out of sync then some commands would necessarily be rejected beneath Raft
// during application (see checkForcedErr).
//
// The proposal buffer also is in charge of advancing the respective range's
// closed timestamp by assigning closed timestamp to proposals. For this
// purpose, new requests starting evaluation needs to synchronize with the
// proposal buffer (see TrackEvaluatingRequest).
//
// Proposals enter the buffer via Insert() or ReinsertLocked(). They are moved
// into Raft via FlushLockedWithRaftGroup() when the buffer fills up, or during

// moving them into Raft directly because Raft would not begin replicating the
