# Here:
# - separate raft engine
# - memtable size split across both engines (64mb each)
#
# We still use tightly coupled truncations. We could not do that in production
# due to durability issues.
# Loosely coupled truncations generally perform worse, since they allow a larger
# window during which raft entries can get flushed to the Raft LSM.
