# This is Experiment 1.3-ish (E1) flavor 1eng-tight.
#
# E1 is the truncation-friendly case: we have only two ranges, so
# when the memtable fills up, most of the raft log entries should already be
# truncated, i.e. very little data should enter the LSM.
#
# Total payload is around 1GiB, so does not drive enough LSM traffic to reason
# about the w-amp on the (state) LSM. But we can understand the Raft-related
# w-amp.
