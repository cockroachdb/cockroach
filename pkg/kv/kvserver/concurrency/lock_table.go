	// - It is unfair for req1 to wait behind req2 at B. The sequence number
	//   assigned to req1 and req2 will restore the fairness by making req1
	//   wait before req2.

	// - req2 (from txn2) arrives at lockTable and only wants to write A.
	//   It proceeds to evaluation and acquires the lock at A for txn2 and then
	//   the request is done. The lock is still held.
	// - req3 (from txn3) wants to write to A and B. It queues at A.
	// - txn2 releases A. req3 is in the front of the queue at A so it claims the
	//   lock and starts waiting at B behind req1.
	// - txn0 releases B. req1 gets to claim the lock at B and does another scan
	//   and adds itself to the queue at A, behind req3 which holds the claim for

// lockTableGuardImpl is an implementation of lockTableGuard.
//
// The struct is a guard that is returned to the request the first time it calls
// lockTable.ScanAndEnqueue() and used in later calls to ScanAndEnqueue() and
// done(). After a call to ScanAndEnqueue() (which is made while holding
// latches), the caller must first call lockTableGuard.StartWaiting() and if it
// returns true release the latches and continue interacting with the
// lockTableGuard. If StartWaiting() returns false, the request can proceed to
// evaluation.
//
// Waiting logic: The interface hides the queues that the request is waiting on,
// and the request's position in the queue. One of the reasons for this hiding
// is that queues are not FIFO since a request that did not wait on a queue for
// key k in a preceding call to ScanAndEnqueue() (because k was not locked and
// there was no queue) may need to wait on the queue in a later call to
// ScanAndEnqueue(). So sequencing of requests arriving at the lockTable is
// partially decided by a sequence number assigned to a request when it first
// called ScanAndEnqueue() and queues are ordered by this sequence number.
// However the sequencing is not fully described by the sequence numbers -- a
// request R1 encountering contention over some keys in its span does not
// prevent a request R2 that has a higher sequence number and overlapping span
// to proceed if R2 does not encounter contention. This concurrency (that is not
// completely fair) is deemed desirable.
//
// The interface exposes an abstracted version of the waiting logic in a way
// that the request that starts waiting is considered waiting for at most one
// other request or transaction. This is exposed as a series of state
// transitions where the transitions are notified via newState() and the current
// state can be read using CurState().
//
//   - The waitFor* states provide information on who the request is waiting for.
//     The waitForDistinguished state is a sub-case -- a distinguished waiter is
//     responsible for taking extra actions e.g. immediately pushing the transaction
//     it is waiting for. The implementation ensures that if there are multiple
//     requests in waitFor state waiting on the same transaction at least one will
//     be a distinguished waiter.
//
//     TODO(sbhola): investigate removing the waitForDistinguished state which
//     will simplify the code here. All waitFor requests would wait (currently
//     50ms) before pushing the transaction (for deadlock detection) they are
//     waiting on, say T. Typically T will be done before 50ms which is considered
//     ok: the one exception we will need to make is if T has the min priority or
//     the waiting transaction has max priority -- in both cases it will push
//     immediately. The bad case is if T is ABORTED: the push will succeed after,
//     and if T left N intents, each push would wait for 50ms, incurring a latency
//     of 50*N ms. A cache of recently encountered ABORTED transactions on each
//     Store should mitigate this latency increase. Whenever a transaction sees a
//     waitFor state, it will consult this cache and if T is found, push
//     immediately (if there isn't already a push in-flight) -- even if T is not
//     initially in the cache, the first push will place it in the cache, so the
//     maximum latency increase is 50ms.
//
//   - The waitElsewhere state is a rare state that is used when the lockTable is
//     under memory pressure and is clearing its internal queue state. Like the
//     waitFor* states, it informs the request who it is waiting for so that
//     deadlock detection works. However, sequencing information inside the
//     lockTable is mostly discarded.
//
//   - The waitSelf state is a rare state when a different request from the same
//     transaction has claimed the lock. See the comment about the concept of
//     claiming a lock on claimantTxn().
//
//   - The waitQueueMaxLengthExceeded state is used to indicate that the request
//     was rejected because it attempted to enter a lock wait-queue as a locking
//     request and found that the queue's length was already equal to or
//     exceeding the request's configured maximum.
//
//   - The doneWaiting state is used to indicate that the request should make
//     another call to ScanAndEnqueue() (that next call is more likely to return a
//     lockTableGuard that returns false from StartWaiting()).

	// Waiters: An active waiter needs to be notified about changes in who it is

	// queuedLockingRequests is a list of requests queued at a key. They may be
	// waiting actively or inactively. The list is maintained in increasing order
	// of sequence numbers. This helps ensure some degree of fairness as requests
	// are released from the head of the queue. Typically, this happens when all
	// locks on the associated key are released.
	//
	// When a lock is not held, the head of the list should be comprised of an
	// inactive, transactional locking request (if the list is non-empty). Keeping
	// its position as an inactive waiter at the head of the queue serves as a
	// claim to prevent other concurrent locking requests (with higher sequence
	// numbers) from barging in front of it. This is important for two reasons:
	//
	// 1. It helps ensure some degree of fairness, as sequence numbers are a proxy
	// for arrival order.
	// 2. Perhaps more importantly, enforcing this ordering helps prevent
	// range-local lock table deadlocks. This is because all locks aren't known
	// upfront to the lock table (as uncontended, replicated locks are only
	// discovered during evaluation). This means that no total ordering of lock
	// acquisition is enforced by the lock table -- using sequence numbers to
	// break ties allows us to prevent deadlocks that could have arisen otherwise.
	//
	// Conversely, a request with a lower sequence number is allowed to barge in
	// front of an inactive waiter with a higher sequence number if the lock is
	// not held. This can be thought of as "breaking the claim" that the higher
	// sequence numbered request tried to establish. As both these requests
	// sequence through the lock table one of them will win the race. This is
	// fine, as the request that wins the race can only evaluate while holding
	// latches and the two requests must conflict on latches. As a result they're
	// guaranteed to be isolated. We don't concern ourselves with the possible
	// fairness issue if the higher sequence number wins the race.
	//
	// Non-locking readers are held separately, in the waitingReaders list. Unlike
	// locking requests, they make no claims on unheld locks. Instead, they race
	// with other locking request(s) that have made a claim.
	//
	// Similarly, non-transactional requests make no claims either, regardless of
	// their read/write status. Non-transactional writers wait in the
	// queuedLockingRequests list along with transactional locking requests. The
	// difference between non-transactional writers and transactional locking
	// requests is as follows:
	//
	// 1. When a lock transitions from held to released, the head of the queue
	// that is made up of non-transactional writes is cleared in one swoop (until
	// we hit the first transactional writer or the queue is entirely drained).
	// This means non-transactional writers race with transactional locking
	// requests' claim(s), like read requests.
	// 2. When deciding whether to wait at an unheld lock or not, a
	// non-transactional writer will check how its sequence number compares to the
	// head of the queuedLockingRequests list. If it's lower, it'll proceed
	// without inserting itself into the queuedLockingRequests list; otherwise,
	// it'll wait.
	//
	// Multiple requests from the same transaction wait independently, including
	// the situation where one of the requests is an inactive waiter at the head
	// of the queue. However, if the inactive waiter manages to sequence,
	// evaluate, and acquire the lock, other requests from the same transaction
	// with lock strength <= the strength with which the lock was acquired are
	// allowed to proceed.
	//
	// The behavior of only one transactional locking request being allowed to
	// make a claim by marking itself as inactive when a lock transitions from
	// held to free is subject to change. As we introduce support for multiple
	// locking strengths, and in particular locking strengths that are compatible
	// with each other (read: shared locks), one could imagine a scheme where the
	// head of the queuedLockingRequests that is compatible with each other is
	// marked as inactive and allowed to proceed. A "joint claim".
	// TODO(arul): update the comment above, this change is coming soon!
	//
	// Once we introduce joint claims, we'll also need to support partially
	// breaking such claims. This means that a request that was previously
	// marked as inactive may have to come back to a lock and actively wait on it.
	// Here's a sketch of what a deadlock could look like if this wasn't
	// supported:
	//
	// - Keys are A, B, C, D.
	// - Key D is locked by some random txn.
	// - req1 from txn1 writes A, B, D. It waits at D.
	// - Some other request from some random txn that writes C arrives,
	//   evaluates, and locks C.
	// - req2 from txn2 that writes A, C. It waits at C.
	// - Some other request from some random txn that writes A arrives,
	//   evaluates, and locks A.
	// - req3 from txn1 that writes A, C. It waits at A. Note that req1 and req3
	//   are from the same txn.
	// - A is unlocked. req3 claims A and waits at C behind req2.
	// - B is locked by some random txn.
	// - D is unlocked. req1 claims D and proceeds to scan again and finds A
	//   is claimed by req3 which is the same txn so becomes a joint
	//   claim holder at A.
	// - Since B is locked, req1 waits at B.
	// - C is unlocked. req2 claims C. It scans and finds req1+req3 holding
	//   the joint claim at A. If it queues behind this joint claim
	//   we have the following situation:
	//           claim      waiter
	//   A     req1+req3     req2
	//   C       req2        req3
	//   This is a deadlock caused by the lock table unless req2 partially

// the possibility of consulting the txnStatusCache in AddDiscoveredLock,
// and not adding the lock if the txn is already finalized, and instead
// telling the caller to do batched intent resolution before calling
// ScanAndEnqueue.
// This reduces memory pressure on the lockTableImpl in the extreme case of
// huge numbers of discovered locks. Note that when there isn't memory
// pressure, the consultation of the txnStatusCache in the ScanAndEnqueue
// achieves the same batched intent resolution. Additionally, adding the lock
// to the lock table allows it to coordinate the population of
// lockTableGuardImpl.toResolve for different requests that encounter the same
// lock, to reduce the likelihood of duplicated intent resolution. This
// coordination could be improved further, as outlined in the comment in
// tryActiveWait, but it hinges on the lock table having the state of the
// discovered lock.
//

// with the count of locks discovered, prior to calling AddDiscoveredLock for
