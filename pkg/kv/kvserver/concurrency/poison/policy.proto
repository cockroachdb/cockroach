// Policy determines how a request will react to encountering a poisoned
// latch. A poisoned latch is a latch for which the holder is unable to make
// progress. That is, waiters of this latch should not expect to be able to
// acquire this latch "for some time"; in practice this is the case of an
// unavailable Replica.
//
// The name is inspired by Rust's mutexes, which undergo poisoning[^1] when a
// thread panics while holding the mutex.
