#  This test sets up the following situation:
#
#     e     <- put  (PoisonPolicyErr; waiting)
#  b---f    <- scan (PoisonPolicyErr; waiting)
#   c       <- put  (PoisonPolicyErr; sequenced, poisoned)
#
# Since everyone uses PoisonPolicyErr, the chain unwinds. However, only `b---f`
# gets an error, since it overlaps `c`. `e` can proceed once `c` and `b---f`
# have finished.
