# Exercise the case where the lock table is cleared due to a lock limit while a
# request's lock table guard is holding a tree snapshot. The removed lockStates
# should be emptied and ignored by requests. This is a regression test against
# the bug described in #99635.
#
# To test this, we sequence a read such that it discovers locks at key "k1" and
# "k2" without exceeding the lock limit. We then re-sequence the read such that
# it captures a lock table tree snapshot and blocks on a lock at key "k1" first.
# Next, we instruct a second read to discover another lock that overflows the
# lock table's lock limit, causing the lock table to be cleared. Finally, we
# release the lock at key "k1" and watch whether the read starts waiting on key
# "k2". If it did, it would get stranded and stall indefinitely.
