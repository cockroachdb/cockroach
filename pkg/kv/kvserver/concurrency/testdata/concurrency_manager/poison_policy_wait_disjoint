#  This test sets up the following situation:
#
#     e     <- put  (PoisonPolicyWait; waiting)
#  b---f    <- scan (PoisonPolicyError; waiting)
#   c       <- put  (PoisonPolicyWait; sequenced, poisoned)
#
# The top and bottom request use PoisonPolicyWait, so the scan returns when `c`
# is poisoned, which in turn lets `e` through. However, `c` continues to wait.
