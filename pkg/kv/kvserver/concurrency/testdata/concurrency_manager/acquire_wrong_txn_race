# -------------------------------------------------------------
# The following sequence of events used to trigger an assertion
# in lock-table that a lock was acquired by a different
# transaction than the current lock holder. This was due to an
# interleaving of concurrent requests holding compatible latches
# that allowed the lock-table state to get out of sync. If scans
# do not acquire latches all the way up to their max timestamp
# (i.e. the max time that they can observe conflicting locks),
# we risk hitting this race condition.
#
# Setup: txn1 acquires lock k at ts 15
#        lock-table is cleared, lock k removed
#        
# Test:  txn2 sequences to scan at ts 10 with max ts 20
#        txn2 observes txn1's lock while evaluation
#        txn2 does not immediately handle-write-intent-error
#        txn1 attempts to commits and resolve its lock
#        txn1 blocks while acquiring latches [*]
#        txn3 blocks while acquiring latches
#        txn2 "discovers" and adds txn1's lock to lock-table
#        txn2 re-sequences and blocks while acquiring latches
#        txn1 proceeds in clearing its lock from the lock-table
#        txn2 proceeds in reading
#        txn3 proceeds in acquiring lock k at ts 25
#
# [*] if txn2 was only holding latches up to its read timestamp
#     and not up to its max timestamp then this wouldn't block,
#     allowing the lock to be removed. txn3 could then proceed
#     after this. Regardless of whether txn2 informed the
#     lock-table about the discovered lock it found from txn1
#     first or txn3 informed the lock-table about the lock it
#     acquired first, the second request would hit an assertion.
