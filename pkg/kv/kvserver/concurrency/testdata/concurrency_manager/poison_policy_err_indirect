#  This test sets up the following situation:
#
#     e     <- put  (PoisonPolicyError; waiting)
#  b---f    <- scan (PoisonPolicyWait; waiting)
#   c       <- put  (PoisonPolicyWait; sequenced, poisoned)
#
# When `c` gets poisoned (and continues waiting), the same
# happens to `b---f`, which prompts `e` to fail fast.
