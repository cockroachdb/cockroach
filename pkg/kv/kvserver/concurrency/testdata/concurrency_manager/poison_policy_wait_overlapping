#  This test sets up the following situation:
#
#   c       <- put  (PoisonPolicyWait; waiting)
#  b---f    <- scan (PoisonPolicyError; waiting)
#   c       <- put  (PoisonPolicyWait; sequenced, poisoned)
#
# When the bottom `c` is poisoned, `b---f` fails fast, and
# the top `c` poisons itself but continues to wait.
