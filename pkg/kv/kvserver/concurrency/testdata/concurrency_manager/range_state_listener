# Disable transaction pushes through this test. Synchronous transaction pushes
# are not immediately terminated when the concurrency manager's lock-table is
# cleared. This is fine from a correctness perspective because it doesn't matter
# which lock-table is initiating a synchronous transaction push, but it makes it
# harder to observe requests responding to lock-table state transitions.
