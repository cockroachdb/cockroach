# -------------------------------------------------------------
# The following sequence of events used to trigger an assertion
# in lock-table that a lock was acquired by a different
# transaction than the current lock holder. This was due to an
# a scan discovering an intent but not informing the lock-table
# about this until after the range lease had been transferred
# away and returned. If the intent was replaced (resolved and
# rewritten by another transaction) during the time that the
# lease was held by a different node, it would be possible for
# the original scan's discovery of the old intent to trigger
# the incorrect transaction assertion.
#
# Setup: txn1 writes intent on key k
#        
# Test:  txn2 sequences and begins evaluating
#        txn2 hits intent, stalls before informing lock-table
#
#        lease is transferred away from node
#        (other node) txn1's intent is resolved
#        (other node) txn2 writes intent on key k
#
#        lease is transferred back to node
#        txn4 sequences and begins evaluating
#        txn4 hits new intent, informs lock-table
#        txn2 unpauses, informs lock-table of txn1's intent [*]
#        txn3 commits
#        txn2 and txn4 proceed
#
# [*] This used to panic. The fix for this was to keep track of the
#     lease epoch that intents are discovered within and to only add
#     those intents to the lock-table if they are from the currently
#     active lease.
