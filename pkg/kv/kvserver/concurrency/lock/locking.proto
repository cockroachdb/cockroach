// Strength represents the different locking strengths that determines how
// key-values can be accessed by concurrent transactions.
//
// Strength applies to locks that are held with a per-key granularity. It is
// up to the users of the key-value layer to decide on which keys to acquire
// locks for when imposing structure that can span multiple keys, such as SQL
// rows (see column families and secondary indexes).
//
// Lock strengths grow from "weakest" to "strongest" in the order that the
// variants are presented in the enumeration. The "stronger" a lock's strength,
// the more restrictive it is to concurrent transactions attempting to access
// the same keys. The strength compatibility detailing these interactions is
// illustrated below.
enum Strength {
  option (gogoproto.goproto_enum_prefix) = false;

  // None represents the absence of a lock or the intention to acquire locks.
  // It corresponds to the behavior of transactions performing key-value reads
  // under optimistic concurrency control. No locks are acquired on the keys
  // read by these requests when they evaluate. However, the reads do respect
  // Exclusive locks already held by other transactions at timestamps equal to
  // or less than their read timestamp.
  //
  // Optimistic concurrency control (OCC) can improve performance under some
  // workloads because it avoids the need to perform any locking during reads.
  // This can increase the amount of concurrency that the system can permit
  // between ongoing transactions. However, OCC does mandate a read validation
  // phase if/when transactions need to commit at a different timestamp than
  // they performed all reads at. CockroachDB calls this a "read refresh",
  // which is implemented by the txnSpanRefresher. If a read refresh fails due
  // to new key-value writes that invalidate what was previously read,
  // transactions are forced to restart. See the comment on txnSpanRefresher
  // for more.
  None = 0;
  
  // Shared (S) locks are used by read-only operations and allow concurrent
  // transactions to read under pessimistic concurrency control. Shared locks
  // are compatible with each other but are not compatible with Update or
  // Exclusive locks. This means that multiple transactions can hold a Shared
  // lock on the same key at the same time, but no other transaction can
  // modify the key at the same time. A holder of a Shared lock on a key is
  // only permitted to read the key's value while the lock is held.
  //
  // Share locks are currently unused, as all KV reads are currently performed
  // optimistically (see None).
  Shared = 1;

  // Update (U) locks are a hybrid of Shared and Exclusive locks which are
  // used to prevent a common form of deadlock. When a transaction intends to
  // modify existing KVs, it is often the case that it reads the KVs first and
  // then attempts to modify them. Under pessimistic concurrency control, this
  // would correspond to first acquiring a Shared lock on the keys and then
  // converting the lock to an Exclusive lock when modifying the keys. If two
  // transactions were to acquire the Shared lock initially and then attempt
  // to update the keys concurrently, both transactions would get stuck
  // waiting for the other to release its Shared lock and a deadlock would
  // occur. To resolve the deadlock, one of the two transactions would need to
  // be aborted.
  //
  // To avoid this potential deadlock problem, an Update lock can be used in
  // place of a Shared lock. Update locks are only compatible with other Shared
  // locks. This means that unlike Shared locks, there may only be a single
  // Update lock holder for a given key. As with Shared locks, the lock holder
  // of an Update lock on a key is only allowed to read from the key while the
  // lock is held. These two requirements help resolve the deadlock scenario
  // presented above because only one of the transactions would be able to
  // acquire an Update lock at a time while reading the initial state of the
  // KVs. This means only one transaction is allowed to upgrade its lock to
  // Exclusive. It may have to wait for concurrent transactions to release their
  // Shared locks, however, there is no deadlock hazard here as the Shared lock
  // holders are not waiting on the Update lock in any way.
  Update = 2;

  // Exclusive (X) locks are used by read-write and read-only operations to
  // provide transactions with (potential) exclusive write access to a key. When
  // an Exclusive lock is held by a transaction on a given key, no other
  // transaction can write to that key.
  //
  // Exclusive locks may provide the lock holder exclusive read access to the
  // key as well. This is a vestige of a time when there was no distinction
  // between exclusive locks and intents; this behavior is configurable, using
  // a cluster setting, and detailed under the compatibility matrix below.
  //
  // Unlike Intents, a transaction can only hold an Exclusive lock on keys that
  // it has not yet modified. This allows optimistic reads to not conflict with
  // Exclusive locks, and improves concurrency between read and write
  // transactions. Note that for this to be meaningful, the write transaction
  // must acquire Exclusive locks as it is executing and only lay down Intents
  // once it is ready to commit.
  //
  // Configuring whether optimistic reads block or do not on Exclusive locks
  // presents a twofold trade-off. First, if the Exclusive lock holder lays down
  // an intent on a key after an optimistic read has observed the state of the
  // key, the transaction that performed the optimistic read may be unable to
  // perform a successful read refresh if it attempts to refresh to a timestamp
  // at or past the timestamp of the Intent. Second, the optimistic read
  // permitted while the Exclusive lock is held will bump the timestamp cache.
  // This may result in the Exclusive lock holder being forced to increase its
  // write timestamp when laying down an Intent, which in turn may force it to
  // restart if its read refresh fails.
  Exclusive = 3;

  // Intent (I) locks are are used by read-write operations to provide
  // transactions sole access to a key. When an Intent lock is held by a
  // transaction on a given key, no other transaction can read from or write to
  // that key. The lock holder is free to read from and write to the key as
  // frequently as it would like.
  Intent = 4;
}

// Mode determines the level of protection a lock provides to the lock holder.
// All locks that are held with a per-key granularity have an associated Mode.
//
// The protection a lock offers is primarily determined by the Strength it is
// held with. However, lock Modes also contain auxiliary information (eg. the
// timestamp at which the lock was acquired, the isolation level associated with
// a non-locking read), which may be used in conjunction with a lock's Strength
// to resolve conflicts between a lock holder and a concurrent overlapping
// request. This allows us to codify conflict rules as a pure function of 2 lock
// Modes.
//
// Users of the key-value layer are expected to indicate locking intentions
// using lock Strengths; lock Mode is an internal concept for the concurrency
// package for conflict resolution.
//
// Compatibility Matrix
//
// The following matrix presents the compatibility of lock Modes with one
// another. A cell with an X means that the two strengths are incompatible with
// each other and that they can not both be held on a given key by different
// transactions, concurrently. A cell without an X means that the two lock Modes
// are compatible with each other and that they can be held on a given key by
// different transactions, concurrently.

// [*] until the re-introduction of weaker isolation levels, all transactions in

// read's timestamp was at or above the Exclusive lock's timestamp. Now that
// there is such a distinction, non-locking reads from serializable transactions
// do not block on Exclusive locks, regardless of their timestamp. However,
// there is a desire to let users opt into the old behavior using the
// ExclusiveLocksBlockNonLockingReads cluster setting. Note that this only
// applies when both the non-locking read and Exclusive lock belong to
// serializable  transactions, as that's the only "old" behavior to speak of
