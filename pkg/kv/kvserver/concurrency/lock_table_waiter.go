	// It may appear that there is a bug here in the handling of request-only

	// the transactions responsible for each of the request, there would be no
	// guarantee that an aborted pusher would notice that its own transaction
	// was aborted before it notices that its pushee's transaction was aborted.
	// For example, in the simplest case, imagine two requests deadlocked on
	// each other. If their transactions are both aborted and each push notices
	// the pushee is aborted first, they will both return here triumphantly and
	// wait for the other to exit its lock wait-queues, leading to deadlock.
	// Even if they eventually pushed each other again, there would be no
	// guarantee that the same thing wouldn't happen.
	//
	// However, such a situation is not possible in practice because such a
	// dependency cycle is never constructed by the lockTable. The lockTable
	// assigns each request a monotonically increasing sequence number upon its
	// initial entrance to the lockTable. This sequence number is used to
	// straighten out dependency chains of requests such that a request only
	// waits on conflicting requests with lower sequence numbers than its own
	// sequence number. This behavior guarantees that request-only dependency
	// cycles are never constructed by the lockTable. Put differently, all
	// dependency cycles must include at least one dependency on a lock and,
	// therefore, one call to pushLockTxn. Unlike pushRequestTxn, pushLockTxn
	// actively removes the conflicting lock and removes the dependency when it
	// determines that its pushee transaction is aborted. This means that the
	// call to pushLockTxn will continue to make forward progress in the case of
	// a simultaneous abort of all transactions behind the members of the cycle,
	// preventing such a hypothesized deadlock from ever materializing.
	//
	// Example:
	//
	//  req(1, txn1), req(1, txn2) are both waiting on a lock held by txn3, and
	//  they respectively hold a reservation on key "a" and key "b". req(2, txn2)
	//  queues up behind the reservation on key "a" and req(2, txn1) queues up
	//  behind the reservation on key "b". Now the dependency cycle between txn1
	//  and txn2 only involves requests, but some of the requests here also
	//  depend on a lock. So when both txn1, txn2 are aborted, the req(1, txn1),
	//  req(1, txn2) are guaranteed to eventually notice through self-directed
	//  QueryTxn requests and will exit the lockTable, allowing req(2, txn1) and
	//  req(2, txn2) to get the reservation and now they no longer depend on each
