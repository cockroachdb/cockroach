	// The replica is being merged into its left-hand neighbor. This request

	//
	// It is very important that this check occur after we have acquired latches
	// from the spanlatch manager. Only after we acquire these latches are we
	// guaranteed that we're not racing with a Subsume command. (Subsume
	// commands declare a conflict with all other commands.) It is also
	// important that this check occur after we have verified that this replica
	// is the leaseholder. Only the leaseholder will have its merge complete
	// channel set.

	// However, we do permit exactly two forms of requests when a range is in
	// the process of being merged into its left-hand neighbor.
	//
	// The first request type that we allow on the RHS of a merge after it has
	// entered its critical phase is a Subsume request. This sounds backwards,
	// but it is necessary to avoid deadlock. While normally a Subsume request
	// will trigger the installation of a mergeComplete channel after it is
	// executed, it may sometimes execute after the mergeComplete channel has
	// been installed. Consider the case where the RHS replica acquires a new
	// lease after the merge transaction deletes its local range descriptor but
	// before the Subsume command is sent. The lease acquisition request will
	// notice the intent on the local range descriptor and install a
	// mergeComplete channel. If the forthcoming Subsume blocked on that
	// channel, the merge transaction would deadlock.
	//
	// This exclusion admits a small race condition. If a Subsume request is
	// sent to the right-hand side of a merge, outside of a merge transaction,
	// after the merge has committed but before the RHS has noticed that the
	// merge has committed, the request may return stale data. Since the merge
	// has committed, the LHS may have processed writes to the keyspace
	// previously owned by the RHS that the RHS is unaware of. This window
	// closes quickly, as the RHS will soon notice the merge transaction has
	// committed and mark itself as destroyed, which prevents it from serving
	// all traffic, including Subsume requests.
	//
	// In our current, careful usage of Subsume, this race condition is
	// irrelevant. Subsume is only sent from within a merge transaction, and
	// merge transactions read the RHS descriptor at the beginning of the
	// transaction to verify that it has not already been merged away.
	if ba.IsSingleSubsumeRequest() {
		return nil
	}
	// The second request type that we allow on the RHS of a merge after it has
	// entered its critical phase is a Refresh request, but only one issued by
	// the active range merge transaction itself, targeting the RHS's local
	// range descriptor. This is necessary to allow the merge transaction to
	// have its write timestamp be bumped and still commit without retrying. In
	// such cases, the transaction must refresh its reads, including its
	// original read on the RHS's local range descriptor. If we were to block
	// this refresh on the frozen RHS range, the merge would deadlock.
	//
	// On the surface, it seems unsafe to permit Refresh requests on an already
	// subsumed RHS range, because the Refresh's effect on the timestamp cache
	// will never make it to the LHS leaseholder. This risks the future joint
	// range serving a write that invalidates the Refresh. However, in this
	// specific situation, we can be sure that such a serializability violation
	// will not occur because the Range merge also writes to (deletes) this key.
	// This means that if the Range merge transaction commits, its intent on the
	// key will be resolved to the timestamp of the refresh and no future write
	// will ever be able to violate the refresh. Conversely, if the Range merge
	// transaction does not commit, then the merge will fail and the update to
	// the RHS's timestamp cache will not be lost (not that this particularly
	// matters in cases of aborted transactions).
	//
	// The same line of reasoning as the one above has motivated us to explore
	// removing keys from a transaction's refresh spans when they are written to
	// by the transaction, as the intents written by the transaction act as a
	// form of pessimistic lock that obviate the need for the optimistic
	// refresh. Such an improvement would eliminate the need for this special
	// case, but until we generalize the mechanism to prune refresh spans based
	// on intent spans, we're forced to live with this.

	// Otherwise, the request must wait. We can't wait for the merge to complete

	// Subsume request to sit in hold its latches forever, deadlocking the
	// merge. Instead, we release the latches we acquired above and return a

// There exists one edge case where the store may learn that it should house
// a replica of the same range with a higher replica ID and then forget.
// If the first raft message this store ever receives for the this range
// contains a replica ID higher than the replica ID in the split trigger
// then an in-memory replica at that higher replica ID will be created and
// no tombstone at a lower replica ID will be written. If the server then
// crashes it will forget that it had ever been the higher replica ID. The
// server may then proceed to process the split and initialize a replica at
// the replica ID implied by the split. This is potentially problematic as
// the replica may have voted as this higher replica ID and when it rediscovers
// the higher replica ID it will delete all of the state corresponding to the
// older replica ID including its hard state which may have been synthesized
// with votes as the newer replica ID. This case tends to be handled safely

// we're still okay because we won't promote a learner unless we succeed in
// sending a learner snapshot. If we fail to send the replica never becomes
// a voter then its votes don't matter and are safe to discard.
