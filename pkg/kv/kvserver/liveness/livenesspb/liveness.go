//
//   - Let's say a node write its liveness record at tWrite. It sets the
//     Expiration field of the record as tExp=tWrite+livenessThreshold.
//     The node is considered LIVE (or DECOMMISSIONING or DRAINING).
//   - At tExp, the IsLive() method starts returning false. The state becomes
//     UNAVAILABLE (or stays DECOMMISSIONING or DRAINING).
//   - Once threshold passes, the node is considered DEAD (or DECOMMISSIONED).
//
// NB: There's a bit of discrepancy between what "Decommissioned" represents, as
// seen by NodeStatusLiveness, and what "Decommissioned" represents as
// understood by MembershipStatus. Currently it's possible for a live node, that
// was marked as fully decommissioned, to have a NodeLivenessStatus of
