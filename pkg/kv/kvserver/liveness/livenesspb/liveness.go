//   - Let's say a node write its liveness record at tWrite. It sets the
//     Expiration field of the record as tExp=tWrite+livenessThreshold.
//     The node is considered LIVE (or DECOMMISSIONING or DRAINING).

// seen by NodeStatusLiveness, and what "Decommissioned" represents as
// understood by MembershipStatus. Currently it's possible for a live node, that
