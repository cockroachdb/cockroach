# Test binding calls which reference names via either types or oid casts work
# after a bizarre turn of events whereby we used to set the planner txn to nil.
# The long and the short of it is that we totally abuse the planner when
# performing BIND and the fact that it continues to carry a transaction that
# does not correspond to the connExecutor's transaction is, generally, a big
# problem. Before the changes made in the commit adding this test, this test
# would result in a nil pointer panic.
