# Regression test for #25726.
# UPSERT over tables with column families, on the fast path, use the
# INSERT logic. This has special casing for column families of 1
# column, and another special casing for column families of 2+
# columns. The special casing is only for families that do not include
# the primary key. So we need a table with 3 families: 1 for the PK, 1
# with just 1 col, and 1 with 2+ cols.
