# strength; We'll also only report a single holder (the other row in there is
# the waiting UPDATE request, not the second shared lock holder). However,
# having this query in here is useful to make sure there are locks and waiters
# on our key, meaning setting the cluster setting above actually did something;
# otherwise, had we used non-locking reads, we'd have failed here.
