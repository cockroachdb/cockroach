# LogicTest: cockroach-go-testserver-configs

# This test verifies that triggers created before the upgrade (which have zero
# trigger_id in their backreferences) are correctly repaired during upgrade.
# Prior to v26.2, trigger dependencies in DependedOnBy had TriggerID=0, making
# them indistinguishable from view dependencies. The V26_2_TriggerBackrefRepair
# upgrade fixes this by setting the correct TriggerID on each backref.
