# This example session documents that a SERIALIZABLE transaction is
# not immediately poisoned when it revisits a Range on which one of
# its intents has had its timestamp pushed. This allows it to continue
# laying down intents in a single pass, despite the possibility that it
# will restart on commit. A SNAPSHOT transaction can always proceed and
# commit with its new timestamp.
#
# Note that ORDER BY id is done on selects which expect more than a
# single result, to account for the distsql config, which randomly
# splits ranges. This can cause table scans to return tuples in any
# arbitrary order.

# Disable transaction write pipelining. Pipelining is not incompatible
# with this test. However, disabling it is the easiest way to remove a
# degree of non-determinism from the test where variants that use
# DistSQL (e.g. fakedist) hear about a transaction retry error due to a
# transaction timestamp push and are unable to refresh it away due to
# the limitation described in #24798. Variants that do not use DistSQL
# transparently refresh this error away.
