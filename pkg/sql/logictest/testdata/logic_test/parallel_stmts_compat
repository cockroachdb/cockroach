# Parallel statement execution was removed in 19.2. See #34789.
# The RETURNING NOTHING syntax was retained to ensure backward compatibility,
# even though the runtime semantics of parallel statements were removed. This
# logic test ensures that we continue to maintain compatibility with clients
# using the syntax, even though it is now ignored.
