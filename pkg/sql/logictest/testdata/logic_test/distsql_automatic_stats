# Note: this statement is flaky on 3node-tenant (which is why that config is
# disabled). Normally, the entire UPDATE in the previous statement is performed
# as a single batch, since the total number of rows updated is 270, which is
# less than the kv batch size of 100k rows (the kv batch size doesn't change in
# this test since the metamorphic config is disabled). The target row count to
# trigger a stats refresh is 205, since 20% of 1000 rows is 200, and
# sql.stats.automatic_collection.min_stale_rows is set to 5 for logictests.
# Since 270 > 205, we should always trigger a refresh.
#
# For some reason, 3node-tenant occasionally splits the UPDATE into 4 pieces,
# with each one affecting at most 88 rows. Since 88 < 205, the refresh is not
# guaranteed, making this test flaky.
