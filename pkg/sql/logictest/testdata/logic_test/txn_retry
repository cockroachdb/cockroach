# TODO(#146732): This test is testing a specific retry path that is
# only used when a statement has resulted in a WriteTimestamp push,
# can't be refreshed by the span refresher interceptor, and also
# hasn't produced an error. In buffered writes, we don't detect this
# WriteTimestamp push until the COMMIT and are no longer eligible for
# the retry path tested here.
#
# It may seem like we could change the read-write conflict to a
# write-write conflict. But the write-write conflict generates an
# error which means it wouldn't test the same retry path.
