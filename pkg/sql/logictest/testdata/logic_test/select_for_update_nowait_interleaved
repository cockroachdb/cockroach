# TODO(nvanbenschoten): merge test cases back into select_for_update once #50050
# is addressed.

# The NOWAIT wait policy returns error indicating location of conflicting lock,
# when possible. This is true even with interleaved scans, which complicate the
# logic of mapping a WriteIntentError back to the corresponding table.
