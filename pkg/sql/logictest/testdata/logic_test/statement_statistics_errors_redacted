# Check that error messages and error codes are being surfaced correctly
#
# For these tests, a statement containing an intentional error is made and the
# crdb_internal.node_statement_statistics virtual table is queried to validate that the error code
# is recorded. When querying the node statistics table, we are ignoring statements made internally
# by CRDB ("$ internal-migration-manager-find-jobs" for example) since they can be flaky. We are
# also ordering by "last_error_code" to maintain consistency. Here we are also testing that the
# error message is redacted for the VIEWACTIVITYREDACTED privilege.
