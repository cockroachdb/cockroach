# Note that we want to test DistSQL physical planning and the obvious choice
# would be to use EXPLAIN (DISTSQL). However, this explain variant doesn't have
# a textual mode which is easier to verify, so we use EXPLAIN (VEC) instead.
# TODO(yuzefovich): consider adding textual mode to EXPLAIN (DISTSQL) and
# using it here.
# TODO(yuzefovich): figure out how we would display plans that have distributed
# stages followed by local ones followed by distributed stages.

# An example of partially distributed plan (due to DOid type that is not
# supported by DistSQL).
