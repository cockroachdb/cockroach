# Regression test for #83754. Note that Postgres is inconsistent
# in evaluation. For example, `SELECT ''::VOID IS DISTINCT FROM NULL::UNKNOWN;`
# errors out, but `SELECT ''::VOID IS DISTINCT FROM NULL;` does not.
# This is due to normalization into an IS NOT NULL op when one operand is NULL.
# The NULL with type cast is not recognized as NULL.
