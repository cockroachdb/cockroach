# This is a sanity check that stmt bundle collection works around the
# V25_2_AddUsernameToStmtDiagRequest migration. Note that we don't inspect the
# contents of the bundles (this is done elsewhere), so the check here is simply
# that the bundle can be collected.

# Note that because only 'query' directive supports 'nodeidx' option, we cannot
# control which node we're talking to, so we'll always talk to node 0. As such,
# we upgrade node 1 followed by node 0 followed by node 2 so that we test the
# following states:
# - cluster is at old version
# - cluster is at mixed version, gateway is at old version
# - cluster is at mixed version, gateway is at new version
# - cluster is at new version.
