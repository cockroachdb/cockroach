// CheckTwoVersionInvariant checks whether any new schema being modified written
// at a version V has only valid leases at version = V - 1. A transaction retry
// error as well as a boolean is returned whenever the invariant is violated.
// Before returning the retry error the current transaction is rolled-back and
// the function waits until there are only outstanding leases on the current
// version. This affords the retry to succeed in the event that there are no
// other schema changes simultaneously contending with this txn.
//
// checkDescriptorTwoVersionInvariant blocks until it's legal for the modified
// descriptors (if any) to be committed.
//
// Reminder: a descriptor version v can only be written at a timestamp
// that's not covered by a lease on version v-2. So, if the current
// txn wants to write some updated descriptors, it needs
// to wait until all incompatible leases are revoked or expire. If
// incompatible leases exist, we'll block waiting for these leases to
// go away. Then, the transaction is restarted by generating a retriable error.
// Note that we're relying on the fact that the number of conflicting
// leases will only go down over time: no new conflicting leases can be
// created as of the time of this call because v-2 can't be leased once
// v-1 exists.
//
// If this method succeeds it is the caller's responsibility to release the
// executor's leases after the txn commits so that schema changes can
// proceed.
