// InvertedIndexColumnKind is the kind of the inverted index on a column. The
// reason this needs to be stored is that we need to be able to check that the
// "opclass" passed into an inverted index declaration (for example,
// gin_trgm_ops) is compatible with the datatype of a particular column
// (gin_tgrm_ops is only valid on text). A future reason is that it's possible
// to desire having more than one type of inverted index on a particular
// datatype - for example, you might want to create a "stemming" inverted index
// on text. And without this extra kind, it wouldn't be possible to distinguish
// a text inverted index that uses trigrams, vs a text inverted index that uses
// stemming.
