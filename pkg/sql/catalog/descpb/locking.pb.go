// ScanLockingStrength controls the row-level locking mode used by scans.
//
// Typically, SQL scans read sequential keys from the key-value layer without
// acquiring any locks. This means that two scans by different transactions will
// not conflict and cause one of the two transactions to block the other. This
// is usually desirable, as it increases concurrency between readers.
//
// However, there are cases where a SQL scan would like to acquire locks on each
// of the keys that it reads to more carefully control concurrent access to the
// data that it reads. The prototypical example of this is a scan that is used
// to fetch the initial value of a row that its transction intends to later
// update. In this case, it would be beneficial to acquire a lock on the row
// during the initial scan instead of waiting until the mutation to acquire a
// lock. This prevents the row from being modified between the scan and the
// mutation. It also prevents situations that can lead to deadlocks.
//
// Locking modes have differing levels of strength, growing from "weakest" to
// "strongest" in the order that the variants are presented in the enumeration.
// The "stronger" a locking mode, the more protection it provides for the lock
// holder but the more restrictive it is to concurrent transactions attempting
// to access the same keys.
//
// The following matrix presents the compatibility of locking strengths with one
// another.
//
