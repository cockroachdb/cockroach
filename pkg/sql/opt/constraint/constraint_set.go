// Set is a conjunction of constraints that are inferred from scalar filter
// conditions. The constrained expression will always evaluate to a result set
// having values that conform to all of the constraints in the constraint set.
// Each constraint within the set is a disjunction of spans that together
// specify the domain of possible values which that constraint's column(s) can
// have. See the Constraint struct comment for more details.
//
// Constraint sets are useful for selecting indexes, pruning ranges, inferring
// non-null columns, and more. They serve as a "summary" of arbitrarily complex
// expressions, so that fast decisions can be made without analyzing the entire
// expression tree each time.
//
// A few examples:
//  - @1 > 10
//      /@1: (/10 - ]
//
//  - @1 > 10 AND @2 = 5
//      /@1: (/10 - ]
//      /@2: [/5 - /5]
//
//  - (@1 = 10 AND @2 > 5) OR (@1 = 20 AND @2 > 0)
//      /@1: [/10 - /10] [/20 - /20]
//      /@2: [/0 - ]
