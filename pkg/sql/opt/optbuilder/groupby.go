package optbuilder

// This file has builder code specific to aggregations (queries with GROUP BY,
// HAVING, or aggregate functions).
//
// We build such queries using three operators:
//
//  - a pre-projection: a ProjectOp which generates the columns needed for
//    the aggregation:
//      - group by expressions
//      - arguments to aggregation functions
//
//  - the aggregation: a GroupByOp which has the pre-projection as the
//    input and produces columns with the results of the aggregation
//    functions. The group by columns are also passed through.
//
//  - a post-projection: calculates expressions using the results of the
//    aggregations; this is analogous to the ProjectOp that we would use for a
//    no-aggregation Select.
//
// For example:
//   SELECT 1 + MIN(v*2) FROM kv GROUP BY k+3
//
//   pre-projection:  k+3 (as col1), v*2 (as col2)
//   aggregation:     group by col1, calculate MIN(col2) (as col3)
//   post-projection: 1 + col3

	// and HAVING expressions contain sub-expressions matching a GROUP BY
	// expression. This enables queries such as:

	//   (1) not explicit GROUP BY columns,
	//   (2) not part of a sub-expression that matches a GROUP BY expression, and
	//   (3) not contained in an aggregate.
	//
	// varsUsed is a slice rather than a set because the builder appends
	// variables found in each sub-expression, and variables from individual
	// sub-expresssions may be removed if they are found to match a GROUP BY
	// expression. If any variables remain in varsUsed when the builder is
	// done building a SELECT expression or HAVING clause, the builder throws
	// an error.
	//
	// For example, consider this query:
	//   SELECT COUNT(*), v/(k+v) FROM t.kv GROUP BY k+v
	// When building the expression v/(k+v), varsUsed will contain the variables
	// shown in brackets after each of the following expressions is built (in
	// order of completed recursive calls):
	//
	//  1.   Build v [v]

	//  4.           \  Build (k+v) [v]  <- truncate varsUsed since (k+v) matches
	//                \   /                 a GROUP BY expression
	//  5.          Build v/(k+v) [v] <- error - build is complete and varsUsed
