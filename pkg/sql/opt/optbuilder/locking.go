// lockingSpec maintains a collection of FOR [KEY] UPDATE/SHARE items that apply
// to a given scope. Locking clauses can be applied to the lockingSpec as they
// come into scope in the AST. The lockingSpec can then be consolidated down to
// a single row-level locking specification for different tables to determine
// how scans over those tables should perform row-level locking, if at all.
//
// A SELECT statement may contain zero, one, or more than one row-level locking
// clause. Each of these clauses consist of two different properties.
//
// The first property is locking strength (see tree.LockingStrength). Locking
// strength represents the degree of protection that a row-level lock provides.
// The stronger the lock, the more protection it provides for the lock holder
// but the more restrictive it is to concurrent transactions attempting to
// access the same row. In order from weakest to strongest, the lock strength
// variants are:
//
//	FOR KEY SHARE
//	FOR SHARE
//	FOR NO KEY UPDATE
//	FOR UPDATE
//
// The second property is the locking wait policy (see tree.LockingWaitPolicy).
// A locking wait policy represents the policy a table scan uses to interact
// with row-level locks held by other transactions. Unlike locking strength,
// locking wait policy is optional to specify in a locking clause. If not
// specified, the policy defaults to blocking and waiting for locks to become
// available. The non-standard policies instruct scans to take other approaches
// to handling locks held by other transactions. These non-standard policies
// are:
//
//	SKIP LOCKED
//	NOWAIT
//
// In addition to these two properties, locking clauses can contain an optional
// list of target relations. When provided, the locking clause applies only to
// those relations in the target list. When not provided, the locking clause
// applies to all relations in the current scope.
//
// Put together, a complex locking spec might look like:
//
//	SELECT ... FROM ... FOR SHARE NOWAIT FOR UPDATE OF t1, t2
//
// which would be represented as:
//
//	[ {ForShare, LockWaitError, []}, {ForUpdate, LockWaitBlock, [t1, t2]} ]
