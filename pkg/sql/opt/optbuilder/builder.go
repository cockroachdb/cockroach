// Builder holds the context needed for building a memo structure from a SQL
// statement. Builder.Build() is the top-level function to perform this build
// process. As part of the build process, it performs name resolution and
// type checking on the expressions within Builder.stmt.
//
// The memo structure is the primary data structure used for query optimization,
// so building the memo is the first step required to optimize a query. The memo
// is maintained inside Builder.factory, which exposes methods to construct
// expression groups inside the memo. Once the expression tree has been built,
// the builder calls SetRoot on the memo to indicate the root memo group, as
// well as the set of physical properties (e.g., row and column ordering) that
// at least one expression in the root group must satisfy.
//
// A memo is essentially a compact representation of a forest of logically-
// equivalent query trees. Each tree is either a logical or a physical plan
// for executing the SQL query. After the build process is complete, the memo
// forest will contain exactly one tree: the logical query plan corresponding
// to the AST of the original SQL statement with some number of "normalization"
// transformations applied. Normalization transformations include heuristics
// such as predicate push-down that should always be applied. They do not
// include "exploration" transformations whose benefit must be evaluated with
// the optimizer's cost model (e.g., join reordering).
//
// See factory.go and memo.go inside the opt/xform package for more details
// about the memo structure.
