# =============================================================================
# prune_cols.opt contains normalization rules that eliminate columns that are
# never used. For example:
#
#   SELECT x FROM (SELECT x, y, z FROM a) WHERE y = 10
#
# The "z" column is never referenced, either by the filter condition or by the
# final projection. Therefore, the query can be rewritten as:
#
#   SELECT x FROM (SELECT x, y FROM a) WHERE y = 10
#
# Unused columns are very common, especially when the SQL * symbol is used to
# select all columns in a table. They can be expensive to fetch and transfer, so
# it's important to retain only columns that are actually needed by the query.
#
# The rules work by "pushing down" a new Project operator into any child inputs
# that have unused columns. The Project only includes columns that are needed by
# some operator in its subtree. The new Project may then spawn a sub-Project of
# its own that gets pushed even further down the tree. Eventually, a Project
# recursively reaches an operator that is capable of filtering columns, like
# Scan or Project, and it will be merged into that operator.
#
# Pruning unused columns is not desirable if the Project operator "gets stuck"
# during push down, and is unable to merge with another column filtering
# operator. This situation causes the expression tree to become littered with
# extra Project operators that impede pattern matching. To avoid this problem,
# the RelationalProps.Rules.PruneCols property tracks columns which can be
# pruned without requiring extra Project operators. The Prune rules use this to
# only push down Project operators that are sure to merge into another operator
# at the end of their journey. See the PruneCols comment for more details.
