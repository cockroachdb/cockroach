# PushFilterIntoJoinLeftAndRight pushes a filter into both the left and right

# both sides. For example, consider this query:
#
#   SELECT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.x=b.x AND a.y=b.y AND a.x + b.y < 5
#
# In this case, we can map a.x + b.y < 5 to both sides based on the equality
# filters a.x=b.x AND a.y=b.y. For the left side, we can map it to
# a.x + a.y < 5, and for the right side, we can map it to b.x + b.y < 5.
# Given this mapping, we can safely push the filter down to both sides and
# remove it from the ON filters list.
#
# Note that this rule is only applied when the left and right inputs do not have
# outer columns. If they do, then this rule can cause undetectable cycles with
# TryDecorrelateSelect, since the filter is pushed down to both sides, but then

# MapFilterIntoJoinLeft maps a filter that is not bound by the left side of

# MapEqualityIntoJoinLeftAndRight checks whether it is possible to map

#
# For example, consider this query:
#
#   SELECT * FROM a, b WHERE a.x = b.x AND b.x = a.y;
#
# As written, both equality conditions contain variables from both sides of
# the join. We can rewrite this query, however, so that only one condition
# spans both sides:
#
#   SELECT * FROM a, b WHERE a.x = a.y AND b.x = a.y;
#
# Now the condition a.x = a.y is fully bound by the left side of the join,
