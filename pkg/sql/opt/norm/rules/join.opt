# PushFilterIntoJoinLeftAndRight pushes a filter into both the left and right

#
#   SELECT * FROM a JOIN b ON a.x=b.x AND a.y=b.y AND a.x + b.y < 5
#
# In this case, we can map a.x + b.y < 5 to both sides based on the equality
# filters a.x=b.x AND a.y=b.y. For the left side, we can map it to
# a.x + a.y < 5, and for the right side, we can map it to b.x + b.y < 5.
# Given this mapping, we can safely push the filter down to both sides and
# remove it from the ON filters list.
# NOTE: It is important that this rule is first among the join filter push-down

# MapFilterIntoJoinLeft maps a filter that is not bound by the left side of
# the join to use the columns from the left side. This will allow
# the filter to be pushed down by the PushFilterIntoJoinLeft rule.
# For example, consider this query:
#
#   SELECT * FROM a INNER JOIN b ON a.x = b.x AND b.x + a.y < 5
#
# In this case, we can map b.x + a.y < 5 to the left side by replacing b.x
# with the equivalent column a.x.
# NOTE: This rule only applies to cases where it is not possible or not safe
#       to map the filter to both sides. If it can be mapped to both sides, it
#       will be handled by PushFilterIntoJoinLeftAndRight (which must be
#       ordered above this rule). For performance reasons, this rule should
#       be ordered before PushFilterIntoJoinLeft (otherwise,
#       PushFilterIntoJoinLeft might need to be applied multiple times).

# PushFilterIntoJoinLeft pushes Join filter conditions into the left side of the
# join. This is possible in the case of InnerJoin and RightJoin, as long as the
# condition has no dependencies on the right side of the join. Left and Full
# joins are not eligible, since filtering left rows will change the number of
# rows in the result for those types of joins:
#
#   -- A row with nulls on the right side is returned for a.x=1, a.y=2, b.x=1.
#   SELECT * FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON a.x=b.x AND a.y < 0
#
#   -- But if the filter is incorrectly pushed down, then no row is returned.
#   SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM a WHERE a.y < 0) a LEFT JOIN b ON a.x=b.x
#
# In addition, AntiJoin is not eligible for this rule, as illustrated by this
# example:
#
#   -- A row is returned for a.y=2.
#   SELECT * FROM a ANTI JOIN b ON a.y < 0
#
#   -- But if the filter is incorrectly pushed down, then no row is returned.
#   SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM a WHERE a.y < 0) a ANTI JOIN b ON True
