# =============================================================================
# bool.opt contains normalization rules for boolean And, Or, Not, and Filters
# operators.
#
# In order to make filter matching easier, the Filters rules create a Filters
# operator to wrap the boolean conditions in Select and Join operators as a
# list of AND'd expressions. For example:
#   (InnerJoin
#     (Scan a)
#     (Scan b)
#     (Filters
#       (Eq (Variable a) (Variable b))
#       (Gt (Variable b) (Const 5))
#     )
#   )
#
# Now other rules can rely upon the presence of the Filters when matching:
#   (Select
#     $input:*
#     (Filters [ ... $conjunct:* ... ])
#   )
