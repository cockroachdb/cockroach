# Pushing the limit as far as possible down the tree shouldn't have negative

# and if the limit is pushed all the way down to a scan, the scan can be limited
# directly.

# In order to prevent this rule from affecting:
#   1. the set of rows kept by the limit,
#   2. the ordinals assigned to those rows by the ordinality, and
#   3. the final ordering of the rows,
# the new limit's ordering should be "extended" to imply the ordinality's
# ordering, so it is set to be an intersection of the original limit ordering
# and the ordinality's ordering (see OrderingChoice.Intersection).

# PushLimitIntoJoinLeft pushes a Limit into the left input of an InnerJoin or
# LeftJoin when rows from the left input are guaranteed to be preserved by the
# join. Since the join creates an output row for each left input row, we only
# need that many rows from that input. We can only do this if the limit ordering
# refers only to the left input columns. We also check that the cardinality of
# the left input is more than the limit, to prevent repeated applications of the
# rule.
#
# Why can we only match InnerJoins and LeftJoins (e.g. not FullJoins)?

# vs
#   SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t_r LIMIT 10) FULL JOIN t_x ON r = x LIMIT 10
#
# In the first query, all rows from t_r (left rows) would have a chance to match
# with a row from t_x. In the second query, left rows that otherwise would have
# matched may be filtered out by the limit. Rows from t_x would then no longer
# have matches, and would be outputted by the FullJoin with the left side
# (t_r columns) null-extended. Therefore, pushing the limit into a join input
# that may be null-extended (either input of a FullJoin) can lead to output rows
# being replaced with null values.
