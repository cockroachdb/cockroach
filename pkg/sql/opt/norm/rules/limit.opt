# PushLimitIntoOrdinality pushes the Limit operator into the Ordinality

# Pushing the limit as far as possible down the tree shouldn't have negative

# and if the limit is pushed all the way down to a scan, the scan can be limited
# directly.

# In order to prevent this rule from affecting:
#   1. the set of rows kept by the limit,
#   2. the ordinals assigned to those rows by the ordinality, and
#   3. the final ordering of the rows,
# the new limit's ordering should be "extended" to imply the ordinality's
# ordering, so it is set to be an intersection of the original limit ordering
# and the ordinality's ordering (see OrderingChoice.Intersection).
