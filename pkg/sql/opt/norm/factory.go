// Factory constructs a normalized expression tree within the memo. As each
// kind of expression is constructed by the factory, it transitively runs
// normalization transformations defined for that expression type. This may
// result in the construction of a different type of expression than what was
// requested. If, after normalization, the expression is already part of the
// memo, then construction is a no-op. Otherwise, a new memo group is created,
// with the normalized expression as its first and only expression.
//
// The result of calling each Factory Construct method is the id of the group
// that was constructed. Callers can access the normalized expression tree that
// the factory constructs by creating a memo.ExprView, like this:

// step, in order to allow any custom manual code to execute.
