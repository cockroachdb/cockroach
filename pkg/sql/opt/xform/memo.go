// memo is a data structure for efficiently storing a forest of query plans.
// Conceptually, the memo is composed of a numbered set of equivalency classes
// called groups where each group contains a set of logically equivalent
// expressions. The different expressions in a single group are called memo
// expressions (memo-ized expressions). A memo expression has a list of child
// groups as its children rather than a list of individual expressions. The
// forest is composed of every possible combination of parent expression with
// its children, recursively applied.
//
// Because memo groups contain logically equivalent expressions, all the memo
// expressions in a group share the same logical properties. However, it's
// possible for two logically equivalent expression to be placed in different
// memo groups. This occurs because determining logical equivalency of two
// relational expressions is too complex to perform 100% correctly. A
// correctness failure (i.e. considering two expressions logically equivalent
// when they are not) results in invalid transformations and invalid plans.
// But placing two logically equivalent expressions in different groups has a
// much gentler failure mode: the memo and transformations are less efficient.
//
// Expressions are inserted into the memo by the factory, which ensure that
// expressions have been fully normalized before insertion (see the comment in
// factory.go for more details). A new group is created only when unique
// normalized expressions are created by the factory during construction or
// rewrite of the tree. Uniqueness is determined by computing the fingerprint
// for a memo expression, which is simply the expression operator and its list
// of child groups. For example, consider this query:
//
//   SELECT * FROM a, b WHERE a.x = b.x
//
// After insertion into the memo, the memo would contain these six groups:
//
//   6: [inner-join [1 2 5]]
//   5: [eq [3 4]]
//   4: [variable b.x]
//   3: [variable a.x]
//   2: [scan b]
//   1: [scan a]
//
// The fingerprint for the inner-join expression is [inner-join [1 2 5]]. The
// memo maintains a map from expression fingerprint to memo group which allows
// quick determination of whether the normalized form of an expression already
// exists in the memo.
//
// The normalizing factory will never add more than one expression to a memo
// group. But the explorer does add denormalized expressions to existing memo
// groups, since oftentimes one of these equivalent, but denormalized
// expressions will have a lower cost than the initial normalized expression
// added by the factory. For example, the join commutativity transformation
// expands the memo like this:
//
//   6: [inner-join [1 2 5]] [inner-join [2 1 5]]
//   5: [eq [3 4]]
//   4: [variable b.x]
//   3: [variable a.x]
//   2: [scan b]
//   1: [scan a]
//
// TODO(andyk): See the comments in explorer.go for more details.
