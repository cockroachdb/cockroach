// JoinOrderBuilder is used to add valid orderings of a given join tree to the
// memo during exploration.
//
// Motivation
// ----------
//
// For any given join tree, it is possible to enumerate all possible orderings
// through exhaustive application of transformation rules. However, enumerating
// join orderings this way leads to a large number of duplicates, which in turn
// significantly impacts planning time. Ideally, each unique join ordering would
// only be enumerated once.
//
// In addition, in the vast majority of cases, the optimal plan for a query does
// not involve introducing cross joins that were not present in the original
// version of the plan. This is because cross joins produce |m| x |n| output
// tuples, where |m| is left input cardinality and |n| is right input
// cardinality. With a query like this:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN ab ON x = a)
//	INNER JOIN uv ON x = u
//
// An ordering like the following is valid but not desirable, since the cross
// join will likely be very expensive compared to a join with a predicate:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM uv INNER JOIN ab ON True)
//	INNER JOIN xy ON x = a AND x = u
//
// Avoiding cross joins significantly decreases the search space (and therefore
// planning time) without preventing the best plan from being found in most
// cases.
//
// Finally, join trees that incorporate non-inner joins should be handled as
// well as inner join trees. This is non-trivial, because non-inner joins are
// much more restrictive than inner joins. For example, the associative property
// does not apply to an inner join in the right input of a left join. Any join
// enumeration method must take care not to introduce invalid orderings.
//
// How JoinOrderBuilder works
// --------------------------
//
// First, the initial join tree is traversed and encoded as a hypergraph (which
// is a graph in which any edge can reference two or more vertexes). The
// 'leaves' of the join tree (base relations) become the vertexes of the graph,
// and the edges are built using the ON conditions of the joins.
//
// Taking this query as an example:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM xy LEFT JOIN ab ON x = a)
//	INNER JOIN uv ON x = u AND (y = b OR b IS NULL)
//
// The vertexes of the graph would represent the base relations xy, ab and uv.
// The three edges would be:
//
//	x = a [left]
//	x = u [inner]
//	y = b OR b IS NULL [inner]
//
// Then, the DPSube algorithm is executed (see citations: [8]). DPSube
// enumerates all disjoint pairs of subsets of base relations such as
// ({xy}, {uv}) or ({xy, uv}, {cd}). This is done efficiently using bit sets.
// For each pair of relation subsets, the edges are iterated over. For each
// edge, if certain edge conditions (to be described in the next section) are
// satisfied, a new join is created using the filters from that edge and the
// relation subsets as inputs.
//
// Avoiding invalid orderings
// --------------------------
//
// Earlier, it was mentioned that edges are restricted in their ability to form
// new joins. How is this accomplished?
//
// The paper 'On the correct and complete enumeration of the core search space'
// introduces the concept of a total eligibility set (TES) (citations: [8]). The
// TES is an extension of the syntactic eligibility set (SES). The SES models
// the producer-consumer relationship of joins and base relations; any relations
// contained in the SES of a join must be present in the join's input. For
// example, take the following query:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM xy
//	LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM ab INNER JOIN uv ON a = u)
//	ON x = u
//
// The SES for the left join will contain relations xy and uv because both are
// referenced by the join's predicate. Therefore, both must be in the input of
// this join for any ordering to be valid.
//
// The TES of an edge is initialized with the SES, and then expanded during
// execution of the CD-C algorithm (see citations: [8] section 5.4). For each
// 'child' join under the current join, associative, left-asscom and
// right-asscom properties are provided by lookup tables (the asscom properties
// are derived from a combination of association and commutation). Depending on
// these properties, the TES will be expanded to take into account whether
// certain transformations of the join tree are valid. During execution of the
// DPSube algorithm, the TES is used to decide whether a given edge can be used
// to construct a new join operator.
//
// Consider the following (invalid) reordering of the above example):
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM ab
//	INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM xy LEFT JOIN uv ON x = u)
//	ON a = u
//
// The left join's TES will include relations xy and uv because they are in the
// SES. The TES will also contain ab because the right-asscom property does not
// hold for a left join and an inner join. Violation of the right-asscom
// property in this context means that the xy and ab relations cannot switch
// places. Because all relations in the join's TES must be a part of its inputs,
// ab cannot be pulled out of the left join. This prevents the invalid plan from
// being considered.
//
// In addition to the TES, 'conflict rules' are also required to detect invalid
// plans. For details, see the methods: calculateTES, addJoins,
// checkNonInnerJoin, and checkInnerJoin.
//
// Special handling of inner joins
// -------------------------------
//
// In general, a join's ON condition must be treated as a single entity, because
// join filter conjuncts cannot usually be pulled out of (or pushed down from)
// the ON condition. However, this restriction can be relaxed for inner joins
// because inner join trees have a unique property: they can be modeled as a
// series of cross joins followed by a series of selects with the inner join
// conjuncts. This allows inner join conjuncts to be treated as 'detached' from
// their original operator, free to be combined with conjuncts from other inner
// joins. For example, take this query:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN ab ON x = a)
//	INNER JOIN uv ON x = u AND a = u
//
// Treating the ON conditions of these joins as a conglomerate (as we do with
// non-inner joins), a join between base relations xy and uv would not be
// possible, because the a = u conjunct requires that the ab base relation also
// be under that edge. However, creating separate edges for each inner join
// conjunct solves this problem, allowing a reordering like the following
// (the ab and uv relations are switched, along with the filters):
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN uv ON x = u)
//	INNER JOIN ab ON x = a AND a = u
//
// In fact, this idea can be taken even further. Take this query as an example:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM xy
//	INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM ab LEFT JOIN uv ON b = v)
//	ON x = a AND (y = u OR u IS NULL)
//
// The following is a valid reformulation:
//
//	SELECT *
//	FROM (SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN ab ON x = a)
//	LEFT JOIN uv ON b = v
//	WHERE y = u OR u IS NULL
//
// Notice the new Select operation that now carries the inner join conjunct that
// references the right side of the left join. We can model the process that
// leads to this reformulation as follows:
//  1. The inner join is rewritten as a cross join and two selects, each
//     carrying a conjunct: (x = a) for one and (y = u OR u IS NULL) for the
//     other.
//  2. The Select operators are pulled above the inner join.
//  3. The left join and inner join are reordered according to the associative
//     property (see citations: [8] table 2).
//  4. Finally, the inner join conjuncts are pushed back down the reordered
//     join tree as far as possible. The x = a conjunct can be pushed to the
//     inner join, but the (y = u OR u IS NULL) conjunct must remain on the
//     Select.
//
// JoinOrderBuilder is able to effect this transformation (though it is not
// accomplished in so many steps).
//
// Note that it would be correct to handle inner joins in the same way as
// non-inner joins, by never splitting up predicates. However, this would
// diminish the search space for plans involving inner joins, and in many cases
// prevent the best plan from being found. It is for this reason that inner
// joins are handled separately.
//
// Also note that this approach to handling inner joins is not discussed in [8].
// Rather, it is an extension of the ideas of [8] motivated by the fact that the
// best plans for many real-world queries require inner joins to be handled in
// this way.
//
// Transitive closure
// ------------------
//
// Treating inner join conjuncts as separate edges allows yet another addition:
// we can add new edges that are implied by the transitive closure of the inner
// join edges. For example, take this query:
//
//	SELECT * FROM xy
//	INNER JOIN ab ON x = a
//	INNER JOIN uv ON a = u
//
// The two edges x = a and a = u are explicit in this join tree. However, there
// is the additional implicit edge x = u which can be added to the join graph.
// Adding this edge allows xy to be joined to uv without introducing a cross
// join. This step of ensuring transitive closure is often crucial to finding
// the best plan; for example, the plan for TPC-H query 9 is much slower without
// it (try commenting out the call to ensureClosure()).

//     enumerated plan unless it was part of the original join tree. This
//     means that a join between two sub-plans is only considered if there is
//     an applicable edge that can be used to construct the join.
//
//  2. The original paper associates each join in the original join tree with
//     exactly one edge in the join hypergraph.
//
//  3. The JoinOrderBuilder departs from the paper by associating each inner
//     join conjunct with an edge. This means that each join can be associated
//     with one or more edges. See the section in the JoinOrderBuilder comment
//     titled "Special handling of inner joins" for details.
//
// (1) and (2) together imply that a reordered join tree is only considered if
// every edge in the hypergraph could be applied to construct a join for every
// subtree. This allows the original algorithm to prevent invalid orderings by
// making a single edge inapplicable. However, because of (3) the same is no

	// s1 and s2 (the edge must connect the two vertex sets).
	//
	// The subset checks ensure that (1) all relations referenced by the predicate
	// are in s1 or s2 as well as that (2) relations cannot move from one side of
	// the join to the other (without explicit allowance). The intersection checks
	// ensure that the two sets are connected by the edge; this prevents new cross
	// joins from being constructed. Take this query as an example:
	//
	//    SELECT *
	//    FROM (SELECT * FROM ab LEFT JOIN uv ON a = u)
	//    INNER JOIN xy
	//    ON (x = v OR v IS NULL)
	//
	// In this query, the xy relation cannot be pushed into the right side of the
	// left join despite the edge between xy and uv because doing so would change
	// the query semantics. How would the TES and conflict rules of the inner join
	// edge prevent this?
	//   1. The TES would first be initialized with the SES: relations xy and uv.
	//   2. Application of CD-C would expand the TES to include ab because
	//      assoc(left-join, inner-join) is false.
	//   3. The TES now includes all three relations, meaning that the inner join
	//      cannot join any two relations together (including xy and uv).
	//
	// Note that checking that the TES intersects both s1 and s2 diverges slightly
	// from the paper. This makes explicit the fact that we forbid the
	// introduction of cross joins that did not exist in the original normalized
	// plan. (The paper checks if the left and right tables intersect s1 and s2
	// respectively). However, the check is exactly equivalent to that given in
	// the paper for the following reasons:
	//   1. For degenerate predicates (one or both inputs not referenced) we add
	//      all base relations from the unreferenced input(s) to the TES
	//      (see calcTES).
	//   2. (1) ensures that (TES ∩ S != ∅) implies (TABLES(input) ∩ S != ∅).
	//   3. Since we discard join orders that introduce new cross-products anyway,
	//      we always filter out cases where (TABLES(input) ∩ S != ∅) but
	//      (TES ∩ S == ∅).
	// Therefore, the check we use here prevents exactly the same reorderings as
	// the check used in the paper.

	// In effect, the difference between the inner and non-inner edge checks is
	// that for inner joins, relations can be moved 'across' the join relative to
	// their positions in the original join tree. This is necessary in order to
	// allow inner join conjuncts from different joins to be combined into new
