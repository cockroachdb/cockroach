// The following is a simplified walkthrough of how the optimizer might handle
// the following SQL query:
//
//   SELECT * FROM a WHERE x=1 ORDER BY y
//
// Before the optimizer is invoked, the memo group contains a single normalized
// expression:
//
//   memo
//    ├── 5: (select 1 4)
//    ├── 4: (eq 3 2)
//    ├── 3: (variable x)
//    ├── 2: (const 1)
//    └── 1: (scan a)
//
// Optimization begins at the root of the memo (group #5), and calls
// optimizeGroup with the properties required of that group ("ordering:y").
// optimizeGroup then calls optimizeExpr for the Select expression, which
// checks whether the expression can provide the required properties. Since
// Select is a pass-through operator, it can provide the properties by passing
// through the requirement to its input. Accordingly, optimizeExpr recursively
// invokes optimizeGroup on select's input child (group #1), with the same set
// of required properties.
//
// Now the same set of steps are applied to group #1. However, the Scan
// expression cannot provide the required ordering (say because it's ordered on
// x rather than y). The optimizer must add a Sort enforcer. It does this by
// recursively invoking optimizeGroup on the same group #1, but this time
// without the ordering requirement. The Scan operator is capable of meeting
// these reduced requirements, so it is costed and added as the current lowest
// cost expression (bestExpr) for that group for that set of properties (i.e.
// the empty set).
//
//   memo

//    └── 1: (scan a)
//         └── "" [cost=100.0]
//              └── best: (scan a)
//
// The recursion pops up a level, and now the Sort enforcer knows its input,
// and so it too can be costed (cost of input + extra cost of sort) and added
// as the best expression for the property set with the ordering requirement.
//
//   memo
//    ├── 5: (select 1 4)

//
// Recursion pops up another level, and the Select operator now knows its input
// (the Sort of the Scan). It then moves on to its scalar filter child and
// optimizes it and its descendants, which is relatively uninteresting since
// there are no enforcers to consider. Once all children have been optimized,
// the Select operator can now be costed and added as the best expression for
// the ordering requirement. It requires the same ordering requirement from its
// input child (i.e. the scan).
//

//
// But the process is not yet complete. After traversing the Select child
// groups, optimizeExpr generates an alternate plan that satisfies the ordering
// property by using a top-level enforcer. It does this by recursively invoking
// optimizeGroup for group #5, but without the ordering requirement, analogous
// to what it did for group #1. This triggers optimization for each child group
// of the Select operator. But this time, the memo already has fully-costed
// best expressions available for both the Input and Filter children, and so
// returns them immediately with no extra work. The Select expression is now
// costed and added as the best expression without an ordering requirement.

//
// Finally, the Sort enforcer for group #5 has its input and can be costed. But
// rather than costing 50.0 like the other Sort enforcer, this one only costs
// 1.0, because it's sorting a tiny set of filtered rows. That means its total
// cost is only 111.0, which makes it the new best expression for group #5 with
// an ordering requirement:
//
//   memo
//    ├── 5: (select 1 4)
//    │    ├── "" [cost=110.0]
//    │    │    └── best: (select 1 4)
