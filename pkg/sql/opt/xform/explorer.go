// explorer generates alternate expressions that are logically equivalent to
// existing expressions in the memo. The new expressions are added to the same
// memo group as the existing expression. The optimizer will cost all the
// expressions and pick the lowest cost alternative that provides any required
// physical properties.
//
// Equivalent expressions are generated by exploration rules. An exploration
// rule efficiently enumerates all possible combinations of its sub-expressions
// in order to look for matches. For example:
//
//  // [AssociateJoin]
//  (InnerJoin
//    (InnerJoin $r:* $s:* $lowerOn:*)
//    $t:*
//    $upperOn:*
//  )
//  =>
//  ...
//
// Say the memo group containing the upper inner-join has 3 expressions in it,
// and the memo group containing the lower inner-join has 4 expressions. Then
// the explorer will enumerate 12 possible expression combinations, looking for
// a combination that has an InnerJoin operator with another InnerJoin operator
// as its left operand.
//
// Once new expressions have been added to a group, they themselves become
// eligible for exploration, which might generate further expressions, and so
// on. Because the same group will often be explored multiple times, the
// explorer keeps state which helps it avoid duplicate work during subsequent
// passes.
//
// The explorer only traverses expression trees to the depth required by the
// exploration match patterns. It expects the optimizer to call exploreGroup
// for each group that needs to be explored. The optimizer can then use branch
// and bound pruning to skip exploration of entire sub-trees.
//
// For each expression combination that matches, a replace expression is
// constructed and added to the same memo group as the matched expression:
//
//  // [AssociateJoin]
//  (InnerJoin
//    (InnerJoin $r:* $s:* $lowerOn:*)
//    $t:*
//    $upperOn:*
//  )
//  =>
//  (InnerJoin
//    (InnerJoin
//      $r
//      $t
//      (Filters (ConstructConditionsNotUsing $s $lowerOn $upperOn))
//    )
//    $s
//    (Filters (ConstructConditionsUsing $s $lowerOn $upperOn))
//  )
//
// In this example, if the upper and lower groups each contain two InnerJoin
// expressions, then four new expressions will be added to the memo group of the
// matched expression. During the next pass, the four new expressions will
// themselves match this same rule. However, adding their replace expressions to
// the memo group will be a no-op, because they're already present.

// exploreGroup generates alternate expressions that are logically equivalent
// to the expressions already in the given group, and adds them to the group.
// The explorer maintains state that tracks which expressions were explored in
// previous passes. It keeps "start" and "end" expressions for the group which
// track the expressions which need to be fully explored during the current
// pass. Each time exploreGroup is called, the end of the previous pass becomes
// the start of the next pass. For example:
//
//   pass1         pass2         pass3
//      <-start
//   e0            e0            e0
//      <-end         <-start
//   e1 (new)      e1            e1
//
//   e2 (new)      e2            e2
//                    <-end         <-start
//                 e3 (new)      e3
//                                  <-end
//
// For rules which match one or more sub-expressions in addition to the top-
// level expression, there is extra complexity because every combination needs
// to be considered. Even expressions which were explored in previous passes
// need to be partially re-explored, because they may match when considered in
// combination with a new sub-expression which wasn't present during the last
// pass. Only combinations which consist solely of old expressions can be
// skipped.
//
// Combination enumeration code is just a series of nested loops generated by
// Optgen. Each non-scalar match pattern or sub-pattern uses a loop to
// enumerate the expressions in the corresponding memo group. For example:
//
//   $join:(InnerJoin
//     $left:(InnerJoin)
//     $right:(Select)
//     $on:*
//   )
//
// This match pattern would be implemented with 3 nested loops: 1 each for the
// $join, $left, and $right memo groups. If $join had 2 expressions, $left had
// 3 expressions, and $right had 2 expressions, then 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 combos will
// be considered. The innermost loop can skip iteration if all outer loops are
// bound to expressions which have already been explored in previous passes:
//
//   for e1 in memo-exprs($join):
//     for e2 in memo-exprs($left):
//       for e3 in memo-exprs($right):
//         if ordinal(e3) >= state.start:
//           ... explore (e1, e2, e3) combo ...
