// Factory constructs a normalized expression tree within the memo. As each
// kind of expression is constructed by the factory, it transitively runs
// normalization transformations defined for that expression type. This may
// result in the construction of a different type of expression than what was
// requested. If, after normalization, the expression is already part of the
// memo, then construction is a no-op. Otherwise, a new memo group is created,
// with the normalized expression as its first and only expression.
//
// Factory is largely auto-generated by optgen. The generated code can be found
// in factory.og.go. The factory.go file contains helper functions that are
// invoked by normalization patterns. While most patterns are specified in the
// optgen DSL, the factory always calls the `onConstruct` method as its last
// step, in order to allow any custom manual code to execute.
