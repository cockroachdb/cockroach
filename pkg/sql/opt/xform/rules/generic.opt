# GenerateParameterizedJoin is an exploration rule that converts a Select
# expression with placeholders and stable expression in the filters into an
# InnerJoin that joins the Select's input with a Values expression that produces
# the placeholder values and stable expressions.
#
# This rule allows generic query plans, in which placeholder values are not
# known and stable expressions are not folded, to be optimized. By converting
# the Select into an InnerJoin, the optimizer can, in many cases, plan a lookup
# join which has similar performance characteristics to the constrained Scan
# that would be planned if the placeholder values were known.
#
# For example, consider a schema and query like:
#
#   CREATE TABLE t (i INT PRIMARY KEY)
#   SELECT * FROM t WHERE i = $1
#
# GenerateParameterizedJoin will perform the first transformation below, from a
# Select into a Join. GenerateLookupJoins will perform the second transformation
# from a (hash) Join into a LookupJoin.
#
#   Select (i=$1)              Join (i=col_$1)         LookupJoin (t@t_pkey)
# 	    |           ->            /   \           ->          |
# 	    |                        /     \                      |
# 	  Scan t             Values ($1)   Scan t              Values ($1)
