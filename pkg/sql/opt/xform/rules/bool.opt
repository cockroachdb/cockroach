# FlattenAnd ensures that And operators are never nested within one another. If

# by merging its conditions into the parent And. Flattened And conditions are
# easier to match and enumerate.

# merging its conditions into the parent Or. Flattened Or conditions are easier

# SimplifyAnd removes True operands from an And operator, and eliminates the
# And operator altogether if any operand is False. If, after simplification,
# no operands remain, then simplifyAnd returns True.
# This rule is especially important when we build a simplified filter.
