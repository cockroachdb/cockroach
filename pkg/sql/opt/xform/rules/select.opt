# GenerateConstrainedScans generates a set of constrained Scan expressions, one
# for each matching index on the scanned table. The expressions consist of
# either a standalone Scan operator (if no remaining filter), or else a Scan
# wrapped by a Select (with a remaining filter). Or, if a secondary index cannot
# provide all the output columns, an IndexJoin is introduced to supply them. See
# the comment for the GenerateConstrainedScans custom method for more details
# and examples.

# GenerateInvertedIndexScans creates alternate expressions for filters that can
