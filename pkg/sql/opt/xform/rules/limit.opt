# GenerateLimitedScans generates a set of limited Scan operators, one for each
# matching index on the scanned table. If the secondary index cannot provide all
# the output columns, an IndexJoin is introduced to supply them. Pushing a limit
# into Scan operators can substantially reduce the cost of execution, as rows
# are never fetched to begin with, rather than fetched only to be discarded by
# a Limit operator.

# PushLimitIntoFilteredScan constructs a new Scan operator that adds a hard row
# limit to an existing Scan operator that already has a constraint or scans a
# partial index. The scan operator always applies the limit after any
# constraint.
#
# Note that PushLimitIntoFilteredScan does not push limits into inverted index
# scans. Inverted index scans are not guaranteed to produce a specific number of
# result rows because they contain multiple entries for a single row indexed.
# Therefore, they cannot be considered for limited scans.

#
#    CREATE TABLE tab (region STRING, data INT NOT NULL, INDEX (region, data));
#
#    SELECT data
#    FROM tab
#    WHERE region='ASIA' OR region='EUROPE'
#    ORDER BY data DESC
#    LIMIT 1;

#
#    SELECT data
#    FROM (SELECT * FROM tab WHERE region='ASIA' ORDER BY data LIMIT 1)
#    UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM tab WHERE region='EUROPE' ORDER BY data LIMIT 1)
#    ORDER BY data

# See the SplitScanIntoUnionScans function in xform/custom_funcs for details.
