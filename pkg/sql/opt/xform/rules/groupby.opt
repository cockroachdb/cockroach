# ReplaceMinWithLimit replaces a Min group-by expression with a limit 1, in the
# case where the group-by returns zero or one groups (i.e. the grouping columns
# are constant). In this situation, the group-by can be entirely replaced by a
# project, similar to this:
#
#   SELECT w, min(k) FROM kw WHERE w = 5 GROUP BY w
#   =>
#   SELECT w, k FROM kw@wk WHERE w = 5 LIMIT 1
#
# This rule may result in a lower cost plan if the column min(k) is applied to
# is indexed.
#
# NOTE: This rule is not fully symmetric with ReplaceMaxWithLimit. This is
# because NULL values sort first in CRDB. This can interfere with the
# calculation of the Min function, because NULL values need to be ignored unless
# the group contains only NULL values (in which case the function returns NULL).
# Therefore, this rule only works when the MIN column is NOT NULL, as only in
# that case is one input row always sufficient to calculate MIN.

# SplitGroupByScanIntoUnionScans splits a non-inverted scan under a GroupBy,

# This is useful because the GenerateStreamingGroupBy rule can then create a
# streaming grouping operation, which is more efficient.
# GenerateStreamingGroupBy will use the new interesting orderings provided by
# the UnionAll of scans to build the streaming operation.

#
#    CREATE TABLE tab (
#      region STRING NOT NULL CHECK (region IN ('ASIA', 'EUROPE')),

# SplitGroupByFilteredScanIntoUnionScans is like SplitGroupByScanIntoUnionScans,
# but the scan is wrapped in a Select.
#
# This transformation is important for ensuring that validation of the
# unique constraint in an implicitly-partitioned unique index is efficient. The
# validation query to verify that (a, b) is UNIQUE on table tbl looks like this:
#
#    SELECT a, b
#    FROM tbl
#    WHERE a IS NOT NULL AND b IS NOT NULL
#    GROUP BY a, b
#    HAVING count(*) > 1
#    LIMIT 1;
#
# Without SplitGroupByFilteredScanIntoUnionScans, this query would require an
# inefficient and memory-intensive hash group by operation. Note that the
# previous rule, SplitGroupByScanIntoUnionScans, is also needed since it would
# apply in cases where a and b are not nullable (the IS NOT NULL filters would
# be eliminated during normalization).

# EliminateIndexJoinInsideGroupBy removes an IndexJoin operator if it can be
# proven that the removal does not affect the output of the parent grouping
# operator. This is the case if:
#
# 1. Only columns from the index join's input are being used by the grouping
#    operator.
#
# 2. The OrderingChoice of the grouping operator can be expressed with only
#    columns from the index join's input. Or in other words, at least one column
#    in every ordering group is one of the output columns from the index join's
#    input.
#
# This rule is useful when using partial indexes. When generating partial index
# scans, expressions can be removed from filters because they exactly match
# expressions in partial index predicates and there is no need to apply the
# filter after the scan. Columns referenced in the removed expressions may no
# longer need to be fetched.
#
# Consider the example:
#
#   CREATE TABLE t (i INT, s STRING, INDEX (i) WHERE s IN ('foo','bar'))
#
#   SELECT DISTINCT i FROM t WHERE s IN ('foo','bar')
#
# The normalized expression for the SELECT query is:
#
#   distinct-on
#    ├── columns: i:1
#    ├── grouping columns: i:1
#    └── select
#         ├── columns: i:1 s:2!null
#         ├── scan t
#         │    └── columns: i:1 s:2
#         └── filters
#              └── s:2 IN ('foo','bar')
#
# GeneratePartialIndexScans will generate this expression:
#
#   distinct-on
#    ├── columns: i:1
#    ├── grouping columns: i:1
#    └── index-join t
#         ├── columns: i:1 s:2!null
#         └── scan t@secondary,partial
#              └── columns: i:1 rowid:4!null
#
# The IndexJoin is created because the Select expression in the previous
# expression required s in order to apply the (s IN ('foo','bar')) filter.
# However, because rows in the partial index are already filtered by
# (s IN ('foo','bar')), column s does not need to be fetched. The IndexJoin
# can be eliminated, resulting in the expression:
#
#   distinct-on
#    ├── columns: i:1
#    ├── grouping columns: i:1
#    └── scan t@secondary,partial
#         └── columns: i:1 rowid:4!null
