# ReorderJoins matches the first expression of an inner join group and adds to
# the memo all valid join orderings that do not introduce cross joins.
# Currently, ReorderJoins can only reorder InnerJoins. If the join has join
# hints or the size of the join tree exceeds ReorderJoinsLimit, the join tree is
# not reordered. For more information, see the comment in join_order_builder.go.

# CommuteSemiJoin generates an InnerJoin that is equivalent to the SemiJoin.
# SemiJoins impose a partial order on the joining tables. We can convert a
# SemiJoin into an InnerJoin by applying a DistinctOn operator on the selected
# rows of the RHS and then relaxing the partial join order restriction.
#
# This allows the join orders (A SemiJoin B) and (Distinct(B*) InnerJoin A) to be
# both considered by the optimizer. This is useful as a different join order may
# allow other rules to trigger. A common case is that, it would allow the inner
# join to use a lookup join in some cases (For example, a different join order
# would allow the use of a lookup join if A has much higher cardinality than B).
#
# We only do this when the On conditions guarantee that for each row in the LHS
# there is at most one unique matching row in the RHS. We need this because a
# SemiJoin emits a maximum of one row for every matching row in the LHS.
# This is an important difference between the behavior of a SemiJoin and an
# InnerJoin. For each row in the LHS, an InnerJoin emits a matching row for every
# row in the RHS where the conditions are met. For example consider the tables:
#
#   lhs       rhs
# +-----+   +------+
#    1         10
#    2         20
#
# If we do an InnerJoin on the table where the On condition is (lhs < rhs),
# you'll notice that each of the lhs rows are matched twice. And so the output
# of the InnerJoin would contain 2 rows for each matching row in the LHS.
# In order to guarantee that there is at most 1 matching row for every row in
# the LHS, we only commute a SemiJoin into an InnerJoin when the On conditions
# are only composed of equalities.
#
# Note: We only consider the columns of the RHS that are used in the On
# conditions (B* in the example above). And so we can be certain that
# ((Distinct(RHS*) InnerJoin LHS) will have at most 1 matching row for each row
# in the LHS if the On conditions are simple equalities.
