// satisfy a required property in multiple ways, and additional information is
// necessary for execution. For example, the required properties may allow
// multiple ordering choices; the provided properties would describe the

	// this operator in order to satisfy its required ordering. This is useful for
	// configuring execution in a distributed setting, where results from multiple
	// nodes may need to be merged. A best-effort attempt is made to have as few
	// columns as possible.
	//
	// The ordering, in conjunction with the functional dependencies (in the
	// logical properties), must intersect the required ordering.

	// See the documentation for the opt/ordering package for some examples.

	// The provided distribution is not yet used when building the DistSQL plan,
	// but eventually it should inform the decision about whether to plan
	// processors locally or remotely. Currently, it is used to determine whether
	// a Distribute operator is needed between this operator and its parent, which
	// can affect the cost of a plan.
