	// time searching subtrees that don't contain subqueries.
	HasCorrelatedSubquery bool

	// CanHaveSideEffects is true if the expression modifies state outside its
	// own scope, or if depends upon state that may change across evaluations. An
	// expression can have side effects if it can do any of the following:
	//
	//   1. Trigger a run-time error
	//        10 / col                          -- division by zero error possible
	//        crdb_internal.force_error('', '') -- triggers run-time error
	//
	//   2. Modify outside session or database state
	//        nextval(seq)               -- modifies database sequence value
	//        SELECT * FROM [INSERT ...] -- inserts rows into database
	//
	//   3. Return different results when repeatedly called with same input
	//        ORDER BY random()      -- random can return different values
	//        ts < clock_timestamp() -- clock_timestamp can return different vals
	//
	// The optimizer makes *only* the following side-effect related guarantees:
	//
	//   1. CASE/IF branches are only evaluated if the branch condition is true.
	//      Therefore, the following is guaranteed to never raise a divide by
	//      zero error, regardless of how cleverly the optimizer rewrites the
	//      expression:
	//
	//        CASE WHEN divisor<>0 THEN dividend / divisor ELSE NULL END
	//
	//      While this example is trivial, a more complex example might have
	//      correlated subqueries that cannot be hoisted outside the CASE
	//      expression in the usual way, since that would trigger premature
	//      evaluation.
	//
	//   2. Expressions with side effects are never treated as constant
	//      expressions, even though they do not depend on other columns in the
	//      query:
	//
	//        SELECT * FROM xy ORDER BY random()
	//
	//      If the random() expression were treated as a constant, then the ORDER
	//      BY could be dropped by the optimizer, since ordering by a constant is
	//      a no-op. Instead, the optimizer treats it like it would an expression
	//      that depends upon a column.
	//
	//   3. A common table expression (CTE) with side effects will only be
	//      evaluated one time. This will typically prevent inlining of the CTE
	//      into the query body. For example:
	//
	//        WITH a AS (INSERT ... RETURNING ...) SELECT * FROM a, a
	//
	//      Although the "a" CTE is referenced twice, it must be evaluated only
	//      one time (and its results cached to satisfy the second reference).
	//
	// As long as the optimizer provides these guarantees, it is free to rewrite,
	// reorder, duplicate, and eliminate as if no side effects were present. As an
	// example, the optimizer is free to eliminate the unused "nextval" column in
	// this query:
	//
	//   SELECT x FROM (SELECT nextval(seq), x FROM xy)
	//   =>
	//   SELECT x FROM xy
	//
	// It's also allowed to duplicate side-effecting expressions during predicate
	// pushdown:
	//
	//   SELECT * FROM xy INNER JOIN xz ON xy.x=xz.x WHERE xy.x=random()
	//   =>
	//   SELECT *
	//   FROM (SELECT * FROM xy WHERE xy.x=random())
	//   INNER JOIN (SELECT * FROM xz WHERE xz.x=random())
	//   ON xy.x=xz.x

	//   a1 a2 b1
	//   --------
	//   1  2  5
	//   1  2  5

	// "bubble up" information about the subtree which can aid in that decision.

	// Whereas the other logical relational properties are filled in by the memo
	// package upon creation of a new memo group, the rules properties are filled
	// in by one of the transformation packages, since deriving rule properties

		// PruneCols is the subset of output columns that can potentially be
		// eliminated by one of the PruneCols normalization rules. Those rules
		// operate by pushing a Project operator down the tree that discards
		// unused columns. For example:
		//
		//   SELECT y FROM xyz WHERE x=1 ORDER BY y LIMIT 1
		//
		// The z column is never referenced, either by the filter or by the
		// limit, and would be part of the PruneCols set for the Limit operator.
		// The final Project operator could then push down a pruning Project
		// operator that eliminated the z column from its subtree.
		//
		// PruneCols is built bottom-up. It typically starts out containing the
		// complete set of output columns in a leaf expression, but quickly
		// empties out at higher levels of the expression tree as the columns
		// are referenced. Drawing from the example above:
		//
		//   Limit PruneCols : [z]
		//   Select PruneCols: [y, z]
		//   Scan PruneCols  : [x, y, z]
		//
		// Only a small number of relational operators are capable of pruning
		// columns (e.g. Scan, Project). A pruning Project operator pushed down
		// the tree must journey downwards until it finds a pruning-capable
		// operator. If a column is part of PruneCols, then it is guaranteed that
		// such an operator exists at the end of the journey. Operators that are
		// not capable of filtering columns (like Explain) will not add any of

		// See the header comments for the reject_nulls.opt file for more
		// information and an example.
		//
		// RejectNullCols is built bottom-up by rulePropsBuilder, and only contains

		// particular, the null rejection rules use this property to determine when
		// it's advantageous to synthesize a new "IS NOT NULL" filter. Without this
