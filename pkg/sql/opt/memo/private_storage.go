// privateStorage stores private values for opt expressions. Each value is
// interned, which means that each unique value is stored at most once. If the
// same value is added twice to storage, the same storage is used, and the same
// private id is returned by the intern method.
//
// To use privateStorage, first call the init method to initialize storage.
// Call one of the intern method to add a private to storage and get back a
// unique private id. Call the lookup method with an id to retrieve a previously
// added private.
//
// Each different type of value needs a key derivation function, which maps
// from the private value to a key value. The key value must be a legal Go map
// key value, and equivalent private values must always map to the same key
// value. For example, the key cannot contain a slice (because it's not a legal
// Go key value) or contain a non-interned pointer (because pointers to
// equivalent values in different memory locations do not map to the same key
// value).
