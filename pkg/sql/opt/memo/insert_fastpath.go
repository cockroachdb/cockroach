// CanAutoCommit determines if it is safe to auto commit the mutation contained
// in the expression.
//
// Mutations can commit the transaction as part of the same KV request,
// potentially taking advantage of the 1PC optimization. This is not ok to do in
// general; a sufficient set of conditions is:
//  1. There is a single mutation in the query.
//  2. The mutation is the root operator, or it is directly under a Project
//     with no side-effecting expressions. An example of why we can't allow
//     side-effecting expressions: if the projection encounters a
//     division-by-zero error, the mutation shouldn't have been committed.
//
// An extra condition relates to how the FK checks are run. If they run before
// the mutation (via the insert fast path), auto commit is possible. If they run
// after the mutation (the general path), auto commit is not possible. It is up
// to the builder logic for each mutation to handle this.
//
// Note that there are other necessary conditions related to execution
// (specifically, that the transaction is implicit); it is up to the exec
// factory to take that into account as well.
