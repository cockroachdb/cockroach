	// A column set is a key if no two rows are equal after projection onto that
	// set. This definition treats NULL as if were equal to NULL, so two rows
	// having duplicate NULL values would *not* qualify as key rows. Therefore,
	// in the usual case, the key columns are also not nullable. The simplest
	// example of a key is the primary key for a table (recall that all of the
	// columns of the primary key are defined to be NOT NULL).
	//
	// A weak key is similar to a key, with the difference that NULL values are
	// treated as *not equal* to other NULL values. Therefore, two rows having
	// duplicate NULL values could still qualify as weak key rows. A UNIQUE index
	// on a table is a weak key and possibly a key if all of the columns are NOT
	// NULL. A weak key is a key if "(WeakKeys[i] & NotNullCols) == WeakKeys[i]".
	//
	// An empty key is valid (an empty key implies there is at most one row). Note
	// that an empty key is always the only key in the set, since it's a subset of
	// every other key (i.e. every other key would be redundant).

	//   WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM b WHERE b.x = a.x AND b.y = 5)
	//
	// For the inner SELECT expression, a.x is an outer column, meaning that it
	// is defined "outside" the SELECT expression (hence the name "outer"). The

	// "outer"). Note that what constitutes an "outer column" is dependent on
	// an expression's location in the query. For example, while the b.x and

	// outer columns on the inner WHERE condition.
