// exprGroup represents a group of relational query plans that are logically
// equivalent to on another. The group points to the first member of the group,
// and subsequent members can be accessed via calls to RelExpr.NextExpr. The
// group maintains the logical properties shared by members of the group, as
// well as the physical properties and cost of the best expression in the group
// once optimization is complete.

// See comments for Memo, RelExpr, Relational, and Physical for more details.
