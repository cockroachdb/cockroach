// Table is an interface to a database table, exposing only the information
// needed by the query optimizer.
//
// Both columns and indexes are grouped into three sets: public, write-only, and
// delete-only. When a column or index is added or dropped, it proceeds through
// each of the three states as that schema change is incrementally rolled out to
// the cluster without blocking ongoing queries. In the public state, reads,
// writes, and deletes are allowed. In the write-only state, only writes and
// deletes are allowed. Finally, in the delete-only state, only deletes are
// allowed. Further details about "online schema change" can be found in:
//
//   docs/RFCS/20151014_online_schema_change.md
//
// Calling code must take care to use the right collection of columns or
// indexes. Usually this should be the public collections, since most usages are
// read-only, but mutation operators generally need to consider non-public
// columns and indexes.
