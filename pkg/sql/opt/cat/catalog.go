// StableID permanently and uniquely identifies a catalog object (table, view,
// index, column, etc.) within its scope:
//
//   data source StableID: unique within database
//   index StableID: unique within table
//   column StableID: unique within table
//
// If a new catalog object is created, it will always be assigned a new StableID
// that has never, and will never, be reused by a different object in the same
// scope. This uniqueness guarantee is true even if the new object has the same
// name and schema as an old (and possibly dropped) object. The StableID will
// never change as long as the object exists.
//
// Note that while two instances of the same catalog object will always have the
// same StableID, they can have different schema if the schema has changed over
// time. See the Version type comments for more details.
//
// For most sqlbase objects, the StableID is the 32-bit descriptor ID. However,
// this is not always the case. For example, the StableID for virtual tables
// prepends the database ID, since the same descriptor ID is reused across
// databases.

// Catalog is an interface to a database catalog, exposing only the information
