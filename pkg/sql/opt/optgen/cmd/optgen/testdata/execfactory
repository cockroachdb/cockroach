// Factory defines the interface for building an execution plan, which consists
// of a tree of execution nodes (currently a sql.planNode tree).
//
// The tree is always built bottom-up. The Construct methods either construct
// leaf nodes, or they take other nodes previously constructed by this same
// factory as children.
//
// The PlanGistFactory further requires that the factory methods be called in
// natural tree order, that is, after an operator's children are constructed the
// next factory method to be called must be the parent of those nodes. The gist's
// flattened tree representation relies on this to enable the use of a stack to
// hold children, thus avoiding the complexity of dealing with other tree traversal
// methods.
//
// The TypedExprs passed to these functions refer to columns of the input node
// via IndexedVars.

	// Checks are executed after all cascades have been executed. They don't
