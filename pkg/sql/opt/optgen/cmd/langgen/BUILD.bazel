# The Optgen language compiler uses itself to generate its AST expressions.
# This is a form of compiler bootstrapping[1], and needs some manual overrides
# to fit into how Bazel wants things to be. We define a second go_library
# target[2], that sources pre-generated og.go files that are already checked
# into the source tree. These files are used to compile langgen, which is then
# used to generate newer revisions of those same generated files. All
# dependents of [3] will need to depend on the og.go files generated in the
# Bazel sandbox, which is achieved by [4]. Conversely, to instruct
# gazelle/Bazel to resolve langgen's import of [3] appropriately, we add the
# resolve directive below.
