# relational.opt contains Optgen language definitions for all of Cockroach's
# physical and logical operators that return a table-valued result having rows
# and columns (i.e. relational). Many of them correspond to operators in the
# relational algebra, but there are also variants that are useful for concisely
# and incrementally expressing transformations.
#
# Tags
#
# Relational - All operators in this file are marked with the Relational tag,
#              so they can be easily distinguished from Scalar and Enforcer
#              operators.
#
# Join - All join operators (inner, left, right, full, semi, anti), as well as
#        their JoinApply variants, are marked with the Join tag, which allows
#        any of them to fulfill a Join pattern match.
#
# JoinApply - All join apply operators are marked with the JoinApply tag.
#             Unlike standard Join operators, JoinApply operators allow the
#             right input to refer to columns projected by the left input.
#             Allowing this is useful as an intermediate (or sometimes final)
#             step in some important transformations (like eliminating
#             subqueries).

# Scan returns a result set containing every row in the specified table. Rows
# and columns are not expected to have any particular ordering. The private
# Table field is a Metadata.TableIndex that references an optbase.Table
# definition in the query's metadata.
[Relational]
define Scan {
    Table TableIndex

# Values returns a manufactured result set containing a constant number of rows
# specified by the Rows list field. Each row must contain the same set of
# columns in the same order. The Cols field contains the set of column indexes
# returned by each row, as a *ColSet.

# InnerJoin represents creates a result set that combines columns from its left
# and right inputs, based upon its "on" join predicate. Rows which do not match
# the predicate are filtered. While expressions in the predicate can refer to
# columns projected by either the left or right inputs, the inputs are not
# allowed to refer to the other's projected columns.
