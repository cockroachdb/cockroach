# enforcer.opt contains Optgen language definitions for "enforcer" operators
# that ensure result sets provide requested physical properties like row sort
# order and column naming. These operators are added by the optimizer on an
# as-needed basis, in order to wrap input expressions that do not naturally
# provide the desired properties.
#
# Tags
#
# Enforcer - All operators in this file are marked with the Enforcer tag, so
#            they can be easily distinguished from Scalar and Relational
#            operators.

# Sort enforces the ordering of rows returned by its input expression. Rows can
# be sorted by one or more of the input columns, each of which can be sorted in
# either ascending or descending order. See the Ordering field in the
# PhysicalProps struct.
# TODO(andyk): Add the Ordering field.
[Enforcer]
define Sort {
    Input Expr
}

# Present enforces physical properties related to column presentation, which
# includes column ordering, column naming, and duplicate columns. While the
# input expression must project the columns used by Present, it can project
# a superset of columns in any order and using any names. Whereas the Project
# operator modifies logical properties (i.e. the set of columns returned), the
# Present operator enforces physical properties (i.e. the presentation of the
# set of columns returned). See the Presentation field in the PhysicalProps
# struct.
# TODO(andyk): Add the Presentation field.
