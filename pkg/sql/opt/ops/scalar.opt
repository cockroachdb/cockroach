# Scalar - All operators in this file are marked with the Scalar tag, so they

# Subquery is a subquery in a single-row context. Here are some examples:
#
#   SELECT 1 = (SELECT 1)
#   SELECT (1, 'a') = (SELECT 1, 'a')`
#
# In a single-row context, the outer query is only valid if the subquery returns
# at most one row. Subqueries in a multi-row context can be transformed to a
# single row context using the Any operator. See the comment above the Any
# operator for more details.
#
# The Input field contains the subquery itself, which should be wrapped in a
# Max1Row operator to enforce that the subquery can return at most one row
# (Max1Row may be removed by the optimizer later if it can determine statically
# that the subquery will always return at most one row). In addition, the
# subquery must project exactly one output column. If the subquery returns one
# row, then that column is bound to the single column value in that row. If the
# subquery returns zero rows, then that column is bound to NULL.

define Subquery {
    Input Expr
}

# Any is a SQL operator that applies a comparison to every row of an input
# subquery and returns true if any of the comparisons are true, else returns
# null if any of the comparisons are null, else returns false. The following
# transformations map from various SQL operators into the Any operator:
#
#   <scalar> IN (<subquery>)
#   ==> (Any <subquery> <scalar> EqOp)
#
#   <scalar> NOT IN (<subquery>)
#   ==> (Not (Any <subquery> <scalar> EqOp))
#
#   <scalar> <comp> {SOME|ANY}(<subquery>)
#   ==> (Any <subquery> <scalar> <comp>)
#
#   <scalar> <comp> ALL(<subquery>)
#   ==> (Not (Any <subquery> <scalar> <negated-comp>))
#
# Any expects the input subquery to return a single column of any data type. The
# scalar value is compared with that column using the specified comparison
# operator.

# Variable is the typed scalar value of a column in the query. The private

# Null is the constant SQL null value that has "unknown value" semantics. If
# the Typ field is not types.Unknown, then the value is known to be in the
# domain of that type. This is important for preserving correct types in
# replacement patterns. For example:
#   (Plus (Function ...) (Const 1))
#
# If the function in that expression has a static type of Int, but then it gets
# constant folded to (Null), then its type must remain as Int. Any other type
# violates logical equivalence of the expression, breaking type inference and
# possibly changing the results of execution. The solution is to tag the null
# with the correct type:
#   (Plus (Null (Int)) (Const 1))
#
# Null is its own operator rather than a Const datum in order to make matching
