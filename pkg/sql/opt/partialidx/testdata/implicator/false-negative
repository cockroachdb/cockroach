# This file contains false negatives: filters that in theory prove implication
# of the corresponding predicates, but in practice the Implicator cannot prove.
#
# False negatives are acceptable because in the worst case, they lead to
# sub-optimal query plans. They prevent the optimizer from considering a scan
# over a partial index when it is theoretically guaranteed that the partial
# index contains the result rows.
#
# False positives are not acceptable because they could produce incorrect query
# results. A false positive would allow the optimizer to consider a scan over a
# partial index when it is not guaranteed that the partial index contains all
# result rows. The effect would be only returning a subset of all rows that
# should be returned.

# A true predicate means that the partial index indexes all rows. Therefore any

# negatives because scans over these "pseudo-partial indexes" are generated by
# the GenerateIndexScans rule, without having to prove implication.
