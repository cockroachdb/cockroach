	// TODO: can we do this with a core feed? we need it to go to the background and not block the connection.
	// if we do it as an enterprise feed/job, licensing aside, we'll need to pass the p.notificationSender thru the job system somehow which sounds shitty.
	//   would need to make the CAs send all data to CFs like in core, and make sure CF is on the right node and session etc?
	// otoh if we do "disown" the flow, how do we UNLISTEN it? on disconnect probably ctx is canceled or smth so that's ok...
	//
	// i think the last guy always runs on the local node. in core case that's the sql node, in enterprise case that's the job node.

	// does the ca usually send all data incl rows to the frontier?? no way
	//  but i think it do though, for core. then the frontier -> recv
	// so then for core feeds, do all CAs need to run on the local node? dont think so
	// so then they send their output to the recv/DistSQLReceiver thingy

	// TODO: getting single quotes around payloads somewhere
	// TODO: what about the requirement that we only start receiving notifications after txn end (if in one)
	// TODO: synchronize connection - notifications async vs data
	// TODO: unlisten, incl on session end
	// - could just make ` write tcp ‹[::1]:26257› -> ‹[::1]:56383›: ‹use of closed network connection›` a non transient err for the latter maybe?

	// currently it seems to only send psql data after i run commands. maybe just a psql artifact, maybe not
	//   defaultdb=> notify hi aaa;
	//   NOTIFY
	//   defaultdb=> ;
	//   Asynchronous notification "hi" with payload "'aaa'" received from server process with PID 16239.
