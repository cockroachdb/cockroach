// HashAggregator is an operator chain that performs an aggregation based on
// specified grouping columns. It's composed of two operators:
// 1. hashGrouper
// 2. orderedAggregator
// This operator chain performs a hash table build at the first call to Next()
// which consumes the entire build source. After the build phase, the state of
// the hashGrouper is changed to buildFinished and the grouped hash table
// buckets are then passed as input to an orderedAggregator. The output row
// ordering of this aggregator is arbitrary.
//
// The high level way this works is:
// 1. build a hash table of its entire input, throwing away non-distinct inputs
// 2. for every key, probe the hash table, populating a linked list array that
//    keeps track of which indexes of the hash table are identical
// 3. traverse the input keys again, determining a single unique key for each
//    group of identical keys. for each unique key, traverse the linked list,
//    marking the index of each identical key in the selection vector
// 4. point the ordered aggregator at the selection vector, so it gets groups of
//    rows with identical equality columns.
//
// TODO(jordan,sqlexec): This works fine, but it's kind of slow. I think the
// reason it's slow is that it has to make a lot of passes over the input, and a
// lot of random access jumps through the large linked list array.
//
// One idea to improve the performance of this is to change the algorithm so
// that the aggregation is performed on demand. This would require reworking the
// individual aggregator functions to be a bit more general, so they don't
// assume usage in the ordered aggregator paradigm, which is why it hasn't been
// tried yet.

// NewHashAggregator creates a hash aggregator on the given grouping
// columns. The input specifications to this function are the same as that of
// the NewOrderedAggregator function.
