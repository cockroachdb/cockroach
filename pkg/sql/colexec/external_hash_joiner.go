	// - The 2 partitions that need to be sorted + merged will use an FD each: 2
	//   FDs. Meanwhile, each sorter will use up to ExternalSorterMinPartitions to
	//   sort and partition this input. At this stage 2 + 2 *
	//   ExternalSorterMinPartitions FDs are used.
	// - Once the inputs (the hash joiner partitions) are finished, both FDs will
	//   be released. The merge joiner will now be in use, which uses two
	//   spillingQueues with 1 FD each for a total of 2. Since each sorter will
	//   use ExternalSorterMinPartitions, the FDs used at this stage are 2 +
	//   (2 * ExternalSorterMinPartitions) as well. Note that as soon as the
	//   sorter emits its first batch, it must be the case that the input to it
	//   has returned a zero batch, and thus the FD has been closed.

// externalHashJoiner is an operator that performs Grace hash join algorithm
// and can spill to disk. The high level view is that it partitions the left
// and right side into large buckets by a hash function A, writes those buckets
// to disk, then iterates through pairs of those buckets and does a normal hash
// join with a different hash function B.
//
// In order to get different hash functions, we're using the same family of
// hash functions that in-memory hash joiner uses, but we will seed it with a
// different initial hash value.
//
// The operator works in two phases.
//
// Phase 1: partitioning
// In this phase, we iterate through both sides of the join, hashing every row
// using a hash function A that produces n partitions. This will produce n
// partitions for each side of the join, which will be persisted to disk
// separately. As memory fills up, each of these partitions is flushed to disk
// repeatedly until the inputs are exhausted.
//
// Phase 2: join
// Now, we retrieve pairs of partitions from disk and join each pair using the
// ordinary hash join algorithm (and a different hash function B). Since we're
// performing an equality join, we can guarantee that each row on the left side
// of the join, if it has a match, will be in the same partition on the right
// side of the join. So, it's safe to do the join in pieces, partition by
// partition.
//
// If one of the partitions itself runs out of memory, we can recursively apply
// this algorithm. The partition will be divided into sub-partitions by a new
// hash function, spilled to disk, and so on. If repartitioning doesn't reduce
// size of the partitions sufficiently, then such partitions will be handled
// using the combination of disk-backed sort and merge join operators.

// NewExternalHashJoiner returns a disk-backed hash joiner.
// - unlimitedAllocator must have been created with a memory account derived
// from an unlimited memory monitor. It will be used by several internal
// components of the external hash joiner which is responsible for making sure
// that the components stay within the memory limit.
