	// buckets (via BuildScratch), depending on the phase of the algorithm. See
	// an extensive comment on hashAggregator.onlineAgg for more details.

	// The unordered distinct uses HeadID in the following manner:
	// - in the first step of the probing phase (when duplicates are being
	// removed from the probing batch), HeadID[i] is set to the first tuple that
	// matches ith tuple. Since ith tuple always matches itself (and possibly
	// others), HeadID values will never be zero in this step;
	// - in the second step of the probing phase (once the batch only contains
	// unique tuples), the non-zero HeadID value is set for a particular tuple
	// once the tuple is determined to not have duplicates with any tuples
	// already in the hash table.

//     iteration:
//     ToCheck = [3]
//     ToCheckID = [x, x, x, 4]
//     HeadID  = [1, 1, 3, x]
//  3. third iteration finds a match for tuple (the tuple itself), no more
//     tuples to check, so the iterations stop:
//     ToCheck = []
//     HeadID  = [1, 1, 3, 4]
//  4. the duplicates are represented by having the same HeadID values, and
//     all duplicates are removed in updateSel:
//     batch = [-6, -6, -7, -5]
//     length = 3, sel = [0, 2, 3]
//     Notably, HashBuffer is compacted accordingly:
//     HashBuffer = [1, 0, 1]
//  3. The hash table is empty, so RemoveDuplicates against the hash table is
//     skipped.

//     to the hash table and will be emitted to the output:

//     chains:
//     ToCheck = [0, 1, 2, 3]
//     ToCheckID = [1, 2, 2, 1]
//     b) after performing the equality check using CheckProbeForDistinct,
//     all tuples are found to be equal to the heads of their hash
//     chains, no more tuples to check, so the iterations stop:
//     ToCheck = []
//     HeadID  = [1, 2, 2, 1]
//  2. the duplicates are represented by having the same HeadID values, and

//     length = 2, sel = [0, 1]

//     a) both tuples included to be checked against heads of their hash
//     chains of the hash table (meaning BuildScratch.First and

//     ToCheck = [0, 1]
//     ToCheckID = [2, 1]
//     b) after performing the equality check using CheckBuildForDistinct,
//     both tuples are found to have hash collisions (-8 with -7 and -5
//     with -6), so both are kept for another iteration:
//     ToCheck = [0, 1]
//     ToCheckID = [0, 2]
//  2. second iteration in FindBuckets finds that tuple 1 (-5) has a match
//     whereas tuple 0 (-8) is distinct (because its ToCheckID is 0), no
//     more tuples to check:
//     ToCheck = []
//     HeadID  = [1, 0]
//  3. duplicates are represented by having HeadID value of 0, so the batch
//     is updated to only include tuple -8:
//     batch = [-8, -5, -5, -8]
//     length = 1, sel = [0]
//     HashBuffer = [0]
//  4. The single tuple still present in the batch is distinct, it is appended
//     to the hash table and will be emitted to the output:
//     Vals = [-6, -7, -5, -8]
//     BuildScratch.First = [2, 1]
//     BuildScratch.Next  = [reserved, 3, 4, 0, 0]
