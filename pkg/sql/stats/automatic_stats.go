// Refresher is responsible for automatically refreshing the table statistics
// that are used by the cost-based optimizer. It is necessary to periodically
// refresh the statistics to prevent them from becoming stale as data in the
// database changes.
//
// The Refresher is designed to schedule a CREATE STATISTICS refresh job after
// approximately X% of total rows have been updated/inserted/deleted in a given
// table. Currently, X is hardcoded to be 5%.
//
// The decision to refresh is based on a percentage rather than a fixed number
// of rows because if a table is huge and rarely updated, we don't want to
// waste time frequently refreshing stats. Likewise, if it's small and rapidly
// updated, we want to update stats more often.
//
// To avoid contention on row update counters, we use a statistical approach.
// For example, suppose we want to refresh stats after 5% of rows are updated
// and there are currently 1M rows in the table. If a user updates 10 rows,
// we use random number generation to refresh stats with probability
// 10/(1M * 0.05) = 0.0002. The general formula is:
//
//                            # rows updated/inserted/deleted
//    p =  --------------------------------------------------------------------
//         (# rows in table) * (target fraction of rows updated before refresh)
//
// The existing statistics in the stats cache are used to get the number of
// rows in the table.
//
// Refresher also implements some heuristic limits designed to corral
// statistical outliers. If we haven't refreshed stats in 2x the average time
// between the last few refreshes, we automatically trigger a refresh. The
// existing statistics in the stats cache are used to calculate the average
// time between refreshes as well as to determine when the stats were last
// updated.
//
// If the decision is made to continue with the refresh, Refresher runs
// CREATE STATISTICS on the given table with the default set of column
// statistics. See comments in sql/create_stats.go for details about which
// default columns are chosen. Refresher runs CREATE STATISTICS with
// AS OF SYSTEM TIME ‘-30s’ to minimize performance impact on running
// transactions.
//
// To avoid adding latency to SQL mutation operations, the Refresher is run
// in one separate background thread per Server. SQL mutation operations signal
// to the Refresher thread by calling NotifyMutation, which sends mutation
// metadata to the Refresher thread over a non-blocking buffered channel. The
// signaling is best-effort; if the channel is full, the metadata will not be
// sent.
