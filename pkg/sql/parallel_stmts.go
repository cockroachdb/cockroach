// ParallelizeQueue maintains a set of planNodes running with parallelized execution.
// Parallelized execution means that multiple statements run asynchronously, with
// their results mocked out to the client and with independent statements allowed
// to run in parallel. Any errors seen when running these statements are delayed
// until the parallelized execution is "synchronized" on the next non-parallelized
// statement. The syntax to parallelize statement execution is the statement with
// RETURNING NOTHING appended to it. The feature is described further in
// docs/RFCS/sql_parallelization.md.

// this knowledge, the queue provides the following guarantees about the execution
// of plans:
// 1. No two plans will ever be run concurrently if they are dependent of one another.
// 2. If two dependent plans are added to the queue, the plan added first will be
//    executed before the plan added second.
// 3. No plans will begin execution once an error has been seen until Wait is
//    called to drain the plans and reset the error-set state.
