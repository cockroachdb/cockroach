// at the same time that are all prefixed with fixed columns (columns
// constrained to constant values) followed by values that must remain
// equal across all sides (such as primary keys). The zigzag joiner takes
// advantage of the sorted order of those equality columns to efficiently
// find rows that satisfy the constant constraints as well as the equality
// constraints.
