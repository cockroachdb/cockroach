// Note: this is a rather awkward implementation to work around the fact that
// Golang doesn't have generic (as of 1.17). Ideally, this would be implemented
// as a generic data structure as something like:
//
// template<typename T>
//
//	class ConcurrentBuffer<T> {
//	  std::vector<T> buffer;
//	  ...
//
// public:
//
//	  void write(T val);
//	  std::vector<T> read() const;
//	};
//
// To work around the lacking of generic, ConcurrentBufferGuard is designed to
// be embedded into higher-level structs that implements the buffer read/write
// operations, where the buffer's access is done in the higher-level structs.

// If the reserved index is valid, AtomicWrite immediately executes the
// bufferWriteOp with the reserved index. However, if the reserved index is not
// valid, (that is, array index out of bound), there are two scenarios:
//  1. If the reserved index == size of the array, then the caller of AtomicWrite()
//     method is responsible for executing the onBufferFullHandler() callback. The
//     caller does so by upgrading the read-lock to a write-lock, therefore
//     blocks all future writers. After the callback is executed, the write-lock
//     is then downgraded to a read-lock.
//  2. If the reserved index > size of the array, then the caller of AtomicWrite()
//     is blocked until the array is flushed. This is achieved by waiting on the
//     conditional variable (flushDone) while holding onto the read-lock. After
//     the flush is completed, the writer is unblocked and allowed to retry.
