	// EnableStepping configures step-wise execution for the statements in the
	// routine. When true, statements within the routine will see mutations made
	// by the statement invoking the routine. They will also see changes made by
	// previous statements in the routine. When false, statements within the
	// routine will see a snapshot of the data as of the start of the statement
	// invoking the routine.

	// CachedResult stores the datum that the routine evaluates to, if the
	// routine is nullary (i.e., it has zero arguments) and stepping is
	// disabled. It is populated during the first execution of the routine.
	// Subsequent invocations of the routine return Result directly, rather than
	// being executed.
	//
	// The cache is never cleared - it lives for the entire lifetime of the
	// routine. Therefore, to "invalidate" the cache, a new routine must be
	// created. For example, consider:
	//
	//   CREATE TABLE t (i INT);
	//   CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS INT VOLATILE LANGUAGE SQL AS $$
	//     SELECT i FROM (VALUES (1), (2)) v(i) WHERE i = (SELECT max(i) FROM t)

	//
	// The optimizer query plan for the SELECT contains two expressions that are
	// built as routines, the UDF and the subquery within it. Each invocation of
	// the UDF's routine will re-plan the body of the function, creating a new
	// routine for the subquery. This effectively "invalidates" the cached
	// result in the subquery routines each time the UDF is invoked. Within a
	// single invocation of the UDF, however, the subquery will only be executed
	// once and the cached result will be returned if the subquery is evaluated

	// NOTE: This boolean only affects evaluation of Routines within project-set
	// operators. This can apply to scalar routines if they are used as data
	// source (e.g. SELECT * FROM scalar_udf()), and always applies to
	// set-returning routines.
