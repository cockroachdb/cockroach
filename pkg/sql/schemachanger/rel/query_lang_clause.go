// tripleDecl is the primary syntactic element of the query language.

// must be the provided value. The value can be a constant, a Var, or a
// set of constants as returned from Any.

// eqDecl allows for the expression of a relationship between a variable
// and an expression. A key distinction between eqDecl and tripleDecl is
// that it allows for the introduction of independently constrained
// non-entity variables. Internally, a eqDecl internally can be viewed as
// introducing two triples: tripleDecl{v, Self, v}, triple{v, Self, expr}
// to enable unification. The key distinction is that the variable is not
// assumed to be an entity.
