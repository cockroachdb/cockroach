// A Phase represents the context in which an op is executed within a schema
// change. Different phases require different dependencies for the execution of
// the ops to be plumbed in.
//
// Today, we support the phases corresponding to async schema changes initiated
// and partially executed in the user transaction. This will change as we
// transition to transactional schema changes.
