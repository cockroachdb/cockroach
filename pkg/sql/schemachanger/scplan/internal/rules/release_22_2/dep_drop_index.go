	// do it once the index is definitely being dropped. The reason for
	// this is roundabout: dropping a column from an index which is itself
	// being dropped is treated as a no-op by the op rules.
	//
	// TODO(ajwerner): This rule really feels like it ought to be a
	// same stage precedence sort of rule where we remove the columns from the
	// index when we remove the index, but for some reason, that overconstrains
	// the graph when dropping the table. Because of that, we allow the column
	// to be removed from the index in DELETE_ONLY, and we no-op the removal.

	// When the whole table is dropped, we can (and in fact, should) remove these
	// right away in-txn. However, when only the index is dropped but the table
	// remains, we need to wait until the index is DELETE_ONLY, which happens
	// post-commit because of the need to uphold the 2-version invariant.
	//
	// We distinguish the two cases using a flag in SecondaryIndexPartial which is
	// set iff the parent relation is dropped. This is a dirty hack, ideally we
	// should be able to express the _absence_ of a target element as a query
	// clause.
