	//
	// When the whole table is dropped, we can (and in fact, should) remove these
	// right away in-txn. However, when only the column is dropped but the table
	// remains, we need to wait until the column is DELETE_ONLY, which happens
	// post-commit because of the need to uphold the 2-version invariant.
	//
	// We distinguish the two cases using a flag in ColumnType which is set iff
	// the parent relation is dropped. This is a dirty hack, ideally we should be
	// able to express the _absence_ of a target element as a query clause.
	//
	// Note that DEFAULT and ON UPDATE expressions are column-dependent elements
	// which also hold references to other descriptors. The rule prior to this one
	// ensures that they transition to ABSENT before scpb.ColumnType does.

	// Column constraint cannot disappear while the column is still writable

	//
	// Column constraint cannot still be enforced when the column becomes
	// non-writable because an enforced constraint means writes will see and
	// attempt to uphold it but the column is no longer visible to them.

	// N.B. This rule supersedes the above "dependents removed before column" rule.
