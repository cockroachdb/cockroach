Documentation of the SQL functions and operators is generated by the `docgen`
utility. The markdown-formatted files are kept in `docs/generated/sql` and
should be re-generated whenever the functions/operators they document change,
and indeed if regenerating produces a diff, a CI failure is expected.

These files are copied to the `docs` repository where they are included in pages
that document SQL. This happens periodically to ensure they stay up-to-date, for
instance during the the release process, but it is also strongly encouraged to
open a docs PR with the updated generated files following any PR that changes
them, so that the relevant context is still fresh in everyone's mind in case any
questions come up.
