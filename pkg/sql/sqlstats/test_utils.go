// (SQL Stats flush / SQL Stats cleanup) is minimized.
//
// However, in a new cluster in unit tests, system tables are created using the
// migration framework. The migration framework goes through a list of
// registered migrations and creates the stats system tables. By using follower
// read, we shift the transaction read timestamp far enough to the past. This
// means it is possible in the unit tests, the read timestamp would be chosen to
// be before the creation of the stats table. This can cause 'descriptor not
// found' error when accessing the stats system table.
//
// Additionally, we don't want to completely remove the AOST clause in the unit
// test. Therefore, `AS OF SYSTEM TIME '-1us'` is a compromise used to get
// around the 'descriptor not found' error.
