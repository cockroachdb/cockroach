- Verion: 6 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - The producer<->consumer (FlowStream RPC) protocol has changed: the
    consumer_signal.handshake field was introduced. The handshake messages are
    sent by the server-side of FlowStream informing the producer of the
    consumer's status. The messages would cause a server running the previous
    version to erroneously think that the consumer has sent a drain signal,
    therefor MinAcceptedVersion was increased.
