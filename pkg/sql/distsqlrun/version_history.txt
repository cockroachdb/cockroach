- Version: 6 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - The producer<->consumer (FlowStream RPC) protocol has changed: the
    consumer_signal.handshake field was introduced. The handshake messages are
    sent by the server-side of FlowStream informing the producer of the
    consumer's status. The messages would cause a server running the previous
    version to erroneously think that the consumer has sent a drain signal,
    therefore MinAcceptedVersion was increased.
- Version: 7 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - Three new aggregations (SQRDIFF, FINAL_VARIANCE, FINAL_STDDEV) were
    introduced to support local and final aggregation of the builtin
    functions STDDEV and VARIANCE.
