- Version: 6 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - The producer<->consumer (FlowStream RPC) protocol has changed: the
    consumer_signal.handshake field was introduced. The handshake messages are
    sent by the server-side of FlowStream informing the producer of the
    consumer's status. The messages would cause a server running the previous
    version to erroneously think that the consumer has sent a drain signal,
    therefore MinAcceptedVersion was increased.
- Version: 7 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - Three new aggregations (SQRDIFF, FINAL_VARIANCE, FINAL_STDDEV) were
    introduced to support local and final aggregation of the builtin
    functions STDDEV and VARIANCE. These new aggregations would be unrecognized
    by a server running older versions, hence the version bump. However, a
    server running v7 can still process all plans from servers running v6,
    thus the MinAcceptedVersion is kept at 6.
- Version: 8 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - An InterleavedReaderJoiner processor was introduced to enable more
    efficient joins between interleaved tables. The new processor spec would be
    unrecognized by a server running older versions, hence the version bump.
    Servers running v8 can still execute regular joins between interleaved
    tables from servers running v6, thus the MinAcceptedVersion is kept at 6.
- Version: 9 (MinAcceptedVersion: 6)
  - A new aggregation FIRST was introduced. This new aggregation would be
    unrecognized by a server running older versions, hence the version bump.
    However, a server running v9 can still process all plans from servers
    running v6, thus the MinAcceptedVersion is kept at 6.
