// DistAggregationInfo is a blueprint for planning distributed aggregations. It
// describes two stages - a local stage performs local aggregations wherever
// data is available and generates partial results, and a final stage aggregates
// the partial results from all data "partitions".
//
// The simplest example is SUM: the local stage computes the SUM of the items
// on each node, and a final stage SUMs those partial sums into a final sum.
// Similar functions are MIN, MAX, BOOL_AND, BOOL_OR.
//
// A less trivial example is COUNT: the local stage counts (COUNT), the final stage
// adds the counts (SUM_INT).
//
// A more complex example is AVG, for which we have to do *multiple*
// aggregations in each stage: we need to get a sum and a count, so the local
// stage does SUM and COUNT, and the final stage does SUM and SUM_INT. We also
// need an expression that takes these two values and generates the final AVG
// result.

	// The local stage consists of one or more aggregations. All aggregations have

	// LocalIdxs).
	FinalStage []FinalStageInfo

	// An optional rendering expression used to obtain the final result; required
	// if there is more than one aggregation in each of the stages.
	//
	// Conceptually this is an expression that has access to the final stage
	// results (via IndexedVars), to be run as the PostProcessing step of the
	// final stage processor.  However, there are some complications:
	//   - this structure is a blueprint for aggregating inputs of different
	//     types, and in some cases the expression may be different depending on
	//     the types (see AVG below).
	//   - we support combining multiple "top level" aggregations into the same
	//     processors, so the correct indexing of the input variables is not
	//     predetermined.
	//
	// Instead of defining a canonical non-typed expression and then tweaking it
	// with visitors, we use a function that directly creates a typed expression
	// on demand. The expression will refer to the final stage results using
	// IndexedVars, with indices specified by varIdxs (1-1 mapping).
