// Setting is the interface exposing the metadata for a cluster setting.
//
// The values for the settings are stored separately in Values. This allows
// having a global (singleton) settings registry while allowing potentially
// multiple "instances" (values) for each setting (e.g. for multiple test
// servers in the same process).
type Setting interface {
	// Class returns the scope of the setting in multi-tenant scenarios.
	Class() Class

	// Key returns the name of the specific cluster setting.
	Key() string

	// Typ returns the short (1 char) string denoting the type of setting.
	Typ() string

	// String returns the string representation of the setting's current value.
	// It's used when materializing results for `SHOW CLUSTER SETTINGS` or `SHOW
	// CLUSTER SETTING <setting-name>`.
	String(sv *Values) string

	// Description contains a helpful text explaining what the specific cluster
	// setting is for.

	// Visibility returns whether or not the setting is made publicly visible.
	// Reserved settings are still accessible to users, but they don't get listed
	// out when retrieving all settings.

	// This is analogous to loading the setting from storage and
	// then calling String() on it, however the setting is not modified.
	// The string representation of the default value can be obtained
	// by calling EncodedDefault() and then DecodeToString().

// Class describes the scope of a setting in multi-tenant scenarios. While all
// settings can be used on the system tenant, the classes restrict use on
// non-system tenants.
//
// Settings can only be registered via the Class, e.g.
// SystemOnly.RegisterIntSetting().
//
// Guidelines for choosing a class:
//
//   - Make sure to read the descriptions below carefully to understand the
//     differences in semantics.
//
//   - If the setting controls a user-visible aspect of SQL, it should be a
//     TenantWritable setting.
//
//   - Control settings relevant to tenant-specific internal implementation
//     should be TenantReadOnly.
//
//   - When in doubt, the first choice to consider should be TenantReadOnly.
//
//   - SystemOnly should be used with caution: even internal tenant code is
//     disallowed from using these settings at all.
