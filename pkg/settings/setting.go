//
//     1. if an end-user may benefit from modifying the setting
//     through a SQL connection to a secondary tenant / virtual
//     cluster, AND different virtual clusters should be able to use
//     different values, the setting should have class
//     ApplicationLevel.
//
//     2. if a setting should only be controlled by SREs in a
//     multi-tenant deployment or in an organization that wishes to
//     shield DB operations from application development, OR the
//     behavior of CockroachDB is not well-defined if multiple tenants
//     (virtual clusters) use different values concurrently, the
//     setting must *not* use class ApplicationLevel.
//
//     3. if and only if a setting relevant to the KV/storage layer
//     and whose value is shared across all virtual clusters is ever
//     accessed by code in the application layer (SQL execution or
//     HTTP handlers), use SystemVisible.
//
//     4. in other cases, use SystemOnly.
type Class int8

	//   - the setting may be accessed from the shared KV/storage layer;
	//
	//   - AND, the setting should only be controllable by SREs (not
	//     end-users) in a multi-tenant environment, AND the behavior
	//     of CockroachDB is not well-defined if different virtual
	//     clusters were to use different values concurrently.

	//     it is not read from SQL code, HTTP handlers or other code
	//     that would run in SQL pods in a multi-tenant environment).
	//
	//     (If this part of the condition does not hold, consider

	//     interface; and we do not wish to display this setting in the

	//     clusters, the class SystemOnly is suitable. Hence the emphasis
	//     on "would run in SQL pods" above.

	// SystemVisible settings are specific to the KV/storage layer and

	// As a rule of thumb, use this class if:

	//   - the setting may be accessed from the shared KV/storage layer;
	//
	//   - AND the setting should only be controllable by operators of
	//     the storage cluster (e.g. SREs in the case of a multi-tenant
	//     environment) but having the storage cluster's value be
	//     observable by virtual clusters is desirable.

	//     (If this part of the condition does not hold, consider
	//     SystemOnly instead.)
	//
	// One use cases is to enable optimizations in the KV client side of
	// virtual cluster RPCs. For example, if the storage layer uses a
	// setting to decide the size of a response, making the setting
	// visible enables the client in virtual cluster code to
	// pre-allocate response buffers to match the size they expect to
	// receive.
	//
	// Another use case is KV/storage feature flags, to enable a UX
	// improvement in virtual clusters by avoiding requesting
	// storage-level functionality when it is not enabled, such as
	// rangefeeds and provide a better error message.
	// (Without this extra logic, the error reported by KV/storage
	// might be hard to read by end-users.)
	//
	// As a reminder, the setting values observed by a virtual cluster,
	// both for its own application settings and those it observes for
	// system-visible settings, can be overridden using ALTER VIRTUAL
	// CLUSTER SET CLUSTER SETTING. This can be used during e.g.
	// troubleshooting, to allow changing the observed value for a
	// virtual cluster without a code change.
	//
	// A setting that is expected to be overridden in regular operation
	// to to control application-level behavior is still an application
	// setting, and should use the application class; system-visible is
	// for use by settings that control the storage layer but need to be
	// visible, rather than for settings that control the application
	// layer but are intended to be read-only. This latter case should
	// use ApplicationLayer, because it controls application behavior,
	// and then rely on an override to prevent modification from within
	// the virtual cluster.
	SystemVisible

	// ApplicationLevel settings are readable and can optionally be
	// modified by virtual clusters.

	//     - end-users may benefit from modifying the setting
	//       through a SQL connection to a secondary tenant / virtual
	//       cluster.
	//
	//       (If this part of the condition does not hold, but the other
	//       part of the condition below does hold, consider still using
	//       ApplicationLevel and force an override using ALTER VIRTUAL
	//       CLUSTER SET CLUSTER SETTING. This makes the
	//       ApplicationLevel setting effectively read-only from the
	//       virtual cluster's perspective, because system overrides
	//       cannot be modified by the virtual cluster.)
	//
