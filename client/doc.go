Package client provides clients for accessing the various
externally-facing Cockroach database endpoints.

KV Client

The KV client is a fully-featured client of Cockroach's key-value
database. It provides a simple, synchronous interface well-suited to
parallel updates and queries.

The simplest way to use the client is through the Call method. Call
synchronously invokes the method and returns the reply and an
error. The example below shows a get and a put.

	host := "localhost:8080"
	sender := client.NewHTTPSender(host, &http.Transport{
		        TLSClientConfig: rpc.LoadInsecureTLSConfig().Config(),
				    })
	kv := client.NewKV(sender, nil)
	kv.User = storage.UserRoot

	getResp := &proto.GetResponse{}
	if err := kv.Call(proto.Get, proto.GetArgs(proto.Key("a")), getResp); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	value := getResp.Value.Bytes
	putResp := &proto.PutResponse{}
	if err := kv.Call(proto.Put, proto.PutArgs(proto.Key("b"), value), putResp); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

The API is synchronous, but accommodates efficient parallel updates
and queries using the Prepare method. An arbitrary number of Prepare
invocations are followed up with a call to Flush. Until the Flush,
requests are buffered locally in anticipation of being sent to
Cockroach as part of a batch. The Flush batches prepared calls and
sends them together. Note however that API calls which are buffered
and sent together are not guaranteed to have atomic semantics. A
transaction must be used to guarantee atomicity. A simple example of
using the API which does two scans in parallel and then sends a
sequence of puts in parallel:

	host := "localhost:8080"
	sender := client.NewHTTPSender(host, &http.Transport{
		TLSClientConfig: rpc.LoadInsecureTLSConfig().Config(),
	})
	kv := client.NewKV(sender, nil)
	kv.User = storage.UserRoot

	acResp, xzResp := &proto.ScanResponse{}, &proto.ScanResponse{}
	kv.Prepare(proto.Scan, proto.ScanArgs(proto.Key("a"), proto.Key("c").Next(), 3), acResp)
	kv.Prepare(proto.Scan, proto.ScanArgs(proto.Key("x"), proto.Key("z").Next(), 3), xzResp)

	// Flush sends both scans in parallel and returns first error or nil.
	if err := kv.Flush(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Append maximum value from "a"-"c" to all values from "x"-"z".
	max := []byte(nil)
	for _, keyVal := range acResp.Rows {
		if bytes.Compare(max, keyVal.Value.Bytes) < 0 {
			max = keyVal.Value.Bytes
		}
	}
	for _, keyVal := range xzResp.Rows {
		putReq := proto.PutArgs(keyVal.Key, bytes.Join([][]byte{keyVal.Value.Bytes, max}, []byte(nil)))
		kv.Prepare(proto.Put, putReq, &proto.PutResponse{})
	}

	// Flush all puts for parallel execution.
	if err := kv.Flush(); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

Transactions are supported through the RunTransaction() method, which
takes a retryable function, itself composed of the same simple mix of
API calls typical of a non-transactional operation. Within the context
of the RunTransaction call, all method invocations are transparently
given necessary transactional details, and conflicts are handled with
backoff/retry loops and transaction restarts as necessary. An example
of using transactions with parallel writes:

  kv := client.NewKV("localhost:8080", tlsConfig)

  opts := client.TransactionOptions{Name: "test", Isolation: proto.SERIALIZABLE}
  err := kv.RunTransaction(opts, func(txn *client.KV) error {
    for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
      key := proto.Key(fmt.Sprintf("testkey-%02d", i))
      txn.Prepare(proto.Put, proto.PutArgs(key, []byte("test value")), &proto.PutResponse{})
    }

    // Note that the KV client is flushed automatically on transaction
    // commit. Invoking Flush after individual API methods is only
    // required if the result needs to be received to take conditional
    // action.
    return nil
  })
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

Note that with Cockroach's lock-free transactions, clients should
expect retries as a matter of course. This is why the transaction
functionality is exposed through a retryable function. The retryable
function should have no side effects which are not idempotent.

Transactions should endeavor to write using KV.Prepare calls. This
allows writes to the same range to be batched together. In cases where
the entire transaction affects only a single range, transactions can
commit in a single round trip.
