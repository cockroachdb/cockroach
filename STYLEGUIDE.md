# CockroachDB Style guide

We're following the
[Google Go Code Review](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
fairly closely. In particular, you want to watch out for proper
punctuation and capitalization in comments. We use two-space indents
in non-Go code (in Go, we follow `gofmt` which indents with
tabs). Format your code assuming it will be read in a window 100
columns wide. Wrap code at 100 characters and comments at 80 unless doing so
makes the code less legible.

When wrapping function signatures that do not fit on one line,
put the name, arguments, and return types on separate lines, with the closing `)`
at the same indentation as `func` (this helps visually separate the indented
arguments from the indented function body). Example:
```go
func (s *someType) myFunctionName(
    arg1 somepackage.SomeArgType, arg2 int, arg3 somepackage.SomeOtherType,
) (somepackage.SomeReturnType, error) {
    ...
}
```

If the arguments list is too long to fit on a single line, switch to one
argument per line:
```go
func (s *someType) myFunctionName(
    arg1 somepackage.SomeArgType,
    arg2 int,
    arg3 somepackage.SomeOtherType,
) (somepackage.SomeReturnType, error) {
    ...
}
```

If the return types need to be wrapped, use the same rules:
```go
func (s *someType) myFunctionName(
    arg1 somepackage.SomeArgType, arg2 somepackage.SomeOtherType,
) (
    somepackage.SomeReturnType,
    somepackage.SomeOtherType,
    error,
) {
    ...
}
```

Exception when omitting repeated types for consecutive arguments:
short and related arguments (e.g. `start, end int64`) should either go on the same line
or the type should be repeated on each line -- no argument should appear by itself
on a line with no type (confusing and brittle when edited).
