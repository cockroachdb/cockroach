# Push binaries to AWS.
# This is run by circle-ci after successful docker push.
# Requisites:
# - binaries must be built by running build/build-binaries.sh
# - circleci must have AWS credentials configured
# - AWS credentials must have S3 write permissions on the bucket
# - the aws cli must be installed on the machine
# - the region must be configured
#
# Ask marc@cockroachlabs.com for the aws credentials file to use, then follow the
# steps in circle.yml to configure aws and generate the binaries.
