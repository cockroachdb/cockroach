# processes trying to clean up the working directory, so we create them here
# as the invoking user to avoid root-owned paths.
#
# Note: this only happens on Linux. On Docker for Mac, the directories are
# still created, but they're owned by the invoking user already. See

# Run our build container with a set of volumes mounted that will
# allow the container to store persistent build data on the host
# computer.
#
# This script supports both circleci and development hosts, so it must
# support cases where the architecture inside the container is
# different from that outside the container. We can map /src/ directly
# into the container because it is architecture-independent. We then
# map certain subdirectories of ${GOPATH}/pkg into both ${GOPATH}/pkg
# and ${GOROOT}/pkg. The ${GOROOT} mapping is needed so they can be
# used to cache builds of the standard library. /bin/ is mapped
# separately to avoid clobbering the host's binaries. Note that the
# path used for the /bin/ mapping is also used in the defaultBinary
# function of localcluster.go.
#
# We always map the cockroach source directory that contains this script into
# the container's $GOPATH/src. By default, we also mount the host's $GOPATH/src
# directory to the container's $GOPATH/src. That behavior can be turned off by
# setting BUILDER_HIDE_GOPATH_SRC to 1, which results in only the cockroach
# source code (and its vendored dependencies) being available within the
# container. This setting is useful to prevent missing vendored dependencies
# from being accidentally resolved to the hosts's copy of those dependencies.

# Ensure that all directories to which the container must be able to write are
# created as the invoking user. Docker would otherwise create them when
# mounting, but that would deny write access to the invoking user since docker
# runs as root.
