# Docker will create the subdirectories on the host side under the directory
# that we're mounting as /root, as the root user. This creates problems for CI
# processes trying to clean up the working directory, so we create them here
# as the invoking user to avoid root-owned paths.

# Note: this only happens on Linux. On Docker for Mac, the directories are
# still created, but they're owned by the invoking user already. See

# This script supports both circleci and development hosts, so it must
# support cases where the architecture inside the container is
# different from that outside the container. We map /src/ directly
# into the container because it is architecture-independent. We then
# map certain subdirectories of ${GOPATH}/pkg into both ${GOPATH}/pkg
# and ${GOROOT}/pkg. The ${GOROOT} mapping is needed so they can be
# used to cache builds of the standard library. /bin/ is mapped
# separately to avoid clobbering the host's binaries. Note that the
# path used for the /bin/ mapping is also used in the defaultBinary
# function of localcluster.go.
#
# -i causes some commands (including `git diff`) to attempt to use
# a pager, so we override $PAGER to disable.
