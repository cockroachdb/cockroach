# This command is used by bazel as the workspace_status_command
# to implement build stamping with git information.

# Usage: stamp.sh [target-triple] [build-channel] [build-type]
# All arguments are optional and have appropriate defaults. In this way,
# stamp.sh with no arguments is appropriate as the `workplace_status_command`
# for a development build.
#  target-triple: defaults to the value of `cc -dumpmachine`
#  build-channel: defaults to `unknown`, but can be `official-binary`
#  build-type: defaults to `development`, but can be `release`
#  build-tag: will default to an appropriate value if not passed in, but can be overridden

# Do not use plumbing commands, like git diff-index, in this target. Our build
# process modifies files quickly enough that plumbing commands report false
# positives on filesystems with only one second of resolution as a performance
# optimization. Porcelain commands, like git diff, exist to detect and remove
# these false positives.
#
# For details, see the "Possible timestamp problems with diff-files?" thread on
