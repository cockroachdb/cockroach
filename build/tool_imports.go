// +build glide

package main

// Our vendoring tool, glide, only considers imports as the set of roots used
// to compute the transitive closure of dependencies it should resolve.
// We depend on many tools which we don't actually import directly elsewhere –
// e.g in a `go generate` or our Makefiles – but convincing `glide` to vendor
// them, and their dependencies, is difficult: https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/issues/690
//
// Thus, instead of trying to use `glide get` or `glide.yaml` to document those
// additional dependency roots, we add fake imports here for glide to find.
// NB: Some of these are `package main` so they cannot actually be imported, so
// this file is build-tagged +glide to prevent attempting to build it.
