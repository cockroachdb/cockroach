# This is mildly tricky: This script runs itself recursively. The
# first time it is run it does not take the if-branch below and
# executes on the host computer. It uses the builder.sh script to run
# itself inside of docker passing "docker" as the argument causing the
# commands in the if-branch to be executed within the docker
# container.
