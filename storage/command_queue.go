// A CommandQueue maintains an interval tree of keys or key ranges for
// executing commands. New commands affecting keys or key ranges must
// wait on already-executing commands which overlap their key range.
//
// Before executing, a command invokes GetWait() to initialize a
// WaitGroup with the number of overlapping commands which are already
// running. The wait group is waited on by the caller for confirmation
// that all overlapping, pending commands have completed and the
// pending command can proceed.
//
// After waiting, a command is added to the queue's already-executing
// set via Add(). Add accepts a parameter indicating whether the
// command is read-only. Read-only commands don't need to wait on
// other read-only commands, so the wait group returned via GetWait()
// doesn't include read-only on read-only overlapping commands as an
// optimization.
//
// Once commands complete, Remove() is invoked to remove the executing
// command and decrement the counts on any pending WaitGroups,
// possibly signaling waiting commands who were gated by the executing
// command's affected key(s).
//
// CommandQueue is not thread safe.

			overlaps = filterReadWrite(overlaps)
		}

		// Sort overlapping commands by command ID and iterate from latest to earliest,
		// adding the commands' ranges to the RangeGroup to determine gating keyspace
		// command dependencies. Because all commands are given WaitGroup dependencies
		// to the most recent commands that they are dependent on, and because of the
		// causality provided by the strictly increasing command ID allocation, this
		// approach will construct a DAG-like dependency graph between WaitGroups with
		// overlapping keys. This comes as an alternative to creating explicit WaitGroups
		// dependencies to all gating commands for each new command, which could result
		// in an exponential dependency explosion.
		//
		// For example, consider the following 5 write commands, each with key ranges
		// represented on the x axis and WaitGroup dependencies represented by vertical
		// lines:
		//
		// cmd 1:   --------------
		//           |      |
		// cmd 2:    |  -------------
		//           |    |    |
		// cmd 3:    -------   |
		//                |    |
		// cmd 4:         -------
		//                   |
		// cmd 5:         -------
		//
		// Instead of having each command establish explicit dependencies on all previous
		// overlapping commands, each command only needs to establish explicit dependencies
		// on the set of overlapping commands closest to the new command that together span
		// the new commands overlapped range. Following this strategy, the other dependencies
		// will be implicitly enforced, which reduces memory utilization and synchronization
		// costs.
		//
		// The exception are existing reads: since reads don't wait for each other, an incoming
		// write must wait for reads even when they are covered by a "later" read (since that
		// "later" read won't wait for the earlier read to complete). However, if that read is
		// covered by a "later" write, we don't need to wait because writes can't be reordered.
		//
		// Two example of how this logic works are shown below. Notice in the first example how
		// the overlapping reads do not establish dependencies on each other, and can therefore
		// be reordered. Also notice in the second example that once read command 4 overlaps
		// a "later" write, it no longer needs to be a dependency for the new write command 5.
		// However, because read command 3 does not overlap a "later" write, it is still a
		// dependency for the new write, but can be safely reordered before or after command 4.
		//
		// cmd 1 [R]:                -----               ----------
		//                             |                        |
