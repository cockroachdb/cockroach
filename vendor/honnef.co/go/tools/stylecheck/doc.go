>         "bar/testutil" // also imports "foo"
>         . "foo"

> In this case, the test file cannot be in package foo because it
> uses \'bar/testutil\', which imports \'foo\'. So we use the \'import .\'
> form to let the file pretend to be part of package foo even though
> it is not. Except for this one case, do not use \'import .\' in your
> programs. It makes the programs much harder to read because it is
> unclear whether a name like \'Quux\' is a top-level identifier in the
> current package or in an imported package.`,

However, this is very rarely done on purpose. Usually, it is a
sign of code that got refactored, accidentally adding duplicate
import statements. It is also a rarely known feature, which may
contribute to confusion.

Do note that sometimes, this feature may be used
intentionally (see for example
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3409ce39bfd7584523b7a8c150a310cea92d879d)
