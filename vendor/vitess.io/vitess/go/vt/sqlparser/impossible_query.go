// FormatImpossibleQuery creates an impossible query in a TrackedBuffer.
// An impossible query is a modified version of a query where all selects have where clauses that are
// impossible for mysql to resolve. This is used in the vtgate and vttablet:
//
// - In the vtgate it's used for joins: if the first query returns no result, then vtgate uses the impossible
// query just to fetch field info from vttablet
// - In the vttablet, it's just an optimization: the field info is fetched once form MySQL, cached and reused
// for subsequent queries
