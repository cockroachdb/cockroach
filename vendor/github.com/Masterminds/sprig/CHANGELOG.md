### Fixed

## Release 2.19.0 (2019-03-02)

IMPORTANT: This release reverts a change from 2.18.0

In the previous release (2.18), we prematurely merged a partial change to the crypto functions that led to creating two sets of crypto functions (I blame @technosophos -- since that's me). This release rolls back that change, and does what was originally intended: It alters the existing crypto functions to use secure random.

We debated whether this classifies as a change worthy of major revision, but given the proximity to the last release, we have decided that treating 2.18 as a faulty release is the correct course of action. We apologize for any inconvenience.

### Changed

## Release 2.17.1 (2019-01-03)
