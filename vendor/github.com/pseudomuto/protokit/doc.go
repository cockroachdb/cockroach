// Package protokit is a library that makes it easy to create your own protoc plugins. It has excellent test coverage,
// and saves you so much time!
//
// There are two main things this library provides; a parser for parsing protobuf files into some well-defined structs,
// and an abstraction to make it simple to write your own protoc plugins.
//
// Getting Started
//
// For a quick view of how to get started, see https://godoc.org/github.com/pseudomuto/protokit#example-RunPlugin
//
// If you want see/try a working example, check out the examples in
// https://github.com/pseudomuto/protokit/tree/master/examples.
