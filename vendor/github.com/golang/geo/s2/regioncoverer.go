// RegionCoverer allows arbitrary regions to be approximated as unions of cells (CellUnion).
// This is useful for implementing various sorts of search and precomputation operations.
//
// Typical usage:
//
//	rc := &s2.RegionCoverer{MaxLevel: 30, MaxCells: 5}
//	r := s2.Region(CapFromCenterArea(center, area))
//	covering := rc.Covering(r)
//
// This yields a CellUnion of at most 5 cells that is guaranteed to cover the
// given region (a disc-shaped region on the sphere).
//
// For covering, only cells where (level - MinLevel) is a multiple of LevelMod will be used.
// This effectively allows the branching factor of the S2 CellID hierarchy to be increased.
// Currently the only parameter values allowed are 1, 2, or 3, corresponding to
// branching factors of 4, 16, and 64 respectively.
//
// Note the following:
//
//  - MinLevel takes priority over MaxCells, i.e. cells below the given level will
//    never be used even if this causes a large number of cells to be returned.
//
//  - For any setting of MaxCells, up to 6 cells may be returned if that
//    is the minimum number of cells required (e.g. if the region intersects
//    all six face cells).  Up to 3 cells may be returned even for very tiny
//    convex regions if they happen to be located at the intersection of
//    three cube faces.
//
//  - For any setting of MaxCells, an arbitrary number of cells may be
//    returned if MinLevel is too high for the region being approximated.
//
//  - If MaxCells is less than 4, the area of the covering may be
//    arbitrarily large compared to the area of the original region even if
//    the region is convex (e.g. a Cap or Rect).
//
// The approximation algorithm is not optimal but does a pretty good job in
// practice. The output does not always use the maximum number of cells
// allowed, both because this would not always yield a better approximation,
// and because MaxCells is a limit on how much work is done exploring the
// possible covering as well as a limit on the final output size.
//
// Because it is an approximation algorithm, one should not rely on the
// stability of the output. In particular, the output of the covering algorithm
// may change across different versions of the library.
//
// One can also generate interior coverings, which are sets of cells which
// are entirely contained within a region. Interior coverings can be
// empty, even for non-empty regions, if there are no cells that satisfy
// the provided constraints and are contained by the region. Note that for
// performance reasons, it is wise to specify a MaxLevel when computing
// interior coverings - otherwise for regions with small or zero area, the
// algorithm may spend a lot of time subdividing cells all the way to leaf
// level to try to find contained cells.
