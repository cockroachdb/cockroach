// Shape represents polygonal geometry in a flexible way. It is organized as a
// collection of edges that optionally defines an interior. All geometry
// represented by a given Shape must have the same dimension, which means that
// an Shape can represent either a set of points, a set of polylines, or a set
// of polygons.
//
// Shape is defined as an interface in order to give clients control over the
// underlying data representation. Sometimes an Shape does not have any data of
// its own, but instead wraps some other type.
//
// Shape operations are typically defined on a ShapeIndex rather than
// individual shapes. An ShapeIndex is simply a collection of Shapes,
// possibly of different dimensions (e.g. 10 points and 3 polygons), organized
// into a data structure for efficient edge access.
//
// The edges of a Shape are indexed by a contiguous range of edge IDs
// starting at 0. The edges are further subdivided into chains, where each
// chain consists of a sequence of edges connected end-to-end (a polyline).
// For example, a Shape representing two polylines AB and CDE would have
// three edges (AB, CD, DE) grouped into two chains: (AB) and (CD, DE).
// Similarly, an Shape representing 5 points would have 5 chains consisting
// of one edge each.
//
// Shape has methods that allow edges to be accessed either using the global
// numbering (edge ID) or within a particular chain. The global numbering is
// sufficient for most purposes, but the chain representation is useful for
// certain algorithms such as intersection (see BooleanOperation).

	// numbered sequentially starting from zero.

	//
	//  1 - Polyline geometry. Polyline edges may be degenerate. A shape may
	//      represent any number of polylines. Polylines edges may intersect.
	//
	//  2 - Polygon geometry. Edges should be oriented such that the polygon
	//      interior is always on the left. In theory the edges may be returned
	//      in any order, but typically the edges are organized as a collection
	//      of edge chains where each chain represents one polygon loop.
