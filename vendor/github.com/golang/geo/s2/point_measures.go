// PointArea returns the area of triangle ABC. This method combines two different
// algorithms to get accurate results for both large and small triangles.
// The maximum error is about 5e-15 (about 0.25 square meters on the Earth's
// surface), the same as GirardArea below, but unlike that method it is
// also accurate for small triangles. Example: when the true area is 100
// square meters, PointArea yields an error about 1 trillion times smaller than
// GirardArea.
//
// All points should be unit length, and no two points should be antipodal.
// The area is always positive.

	// This method is based on l'Huilier's theorem,
	//
	//   tan(E/4) = sqrt(tan(s/2) tan((s-a)/2) tan((s-b)/2) tan((s-c)/2))
	//
	// where E is the spherical excess of the triangle (i.e. its area),
	//       a, b, c are the side lengths, and
	//       s is the semiperimeter (a + b + c) / 2.
	//
	// The only significant source of error using l'Huilier's method is the
	// cancellation error of the terms (s-a), (s-b), (s-c). This leads to a
	// *relative* error of about 1e-16 * s / min(s-a, s-b, s-c). This compares
	// to a relative error of about 1e-15 / E using Girard's formula, where E is
	// the true area of the triangle. Girard's formula can be even worse than
	// this for very small triangles, e.g. a triangle with a true area of 1e-30
	// might evaluate to 1e-5.
	//
	// So, we prefer l'Huilier's formula unless dmin < s * (0.1 * E), where
	// dmin = min(s-a, s-b, s-c). This basically includes all triangles
	// except for extremely long and skinny ones.
	//
	// Since we don't know E, we would like a conservative upper bound on
	// the triangle area in terms of s and dmin. It's possible to show that
	// E <= k1 * s * sqrt(s * dmin), where k1 = 2*sqrt(3)/Pi (about 1).
	// Using this, it's easy to show that we should always use l'Huilier's
	// method if dmin >= k2 * s^5, where k2 is about 1e-2. Furthermore,
	// if dmin < k2 * s^5, the triangle area is at most k3 * s^4, where
