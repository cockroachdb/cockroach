# The importable parts of Twirp have no external dependencies. They just use the
# standard library. But both protoc-gen-twirp and Twirp's tests *do* have some
# dependencies, and this manifest lists them.
#
# All dependencies are specified as overrides, not constraints, so that dep
# doesn't get confused if someone imports Twirp. We don't want to falsely
# require any particular versions of these libraries - they are *only* for
# tests and building main packages.
