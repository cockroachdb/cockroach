// InternalIterator iterates over a DB's key/value pairs in key order. Unlike
// the Iterator interface, the returned keys are InternalKeys composed of the
// user-key, a sequence number and a key kind. In forward iteration, key/value
// pairs for identical user-keys are returned in descending sequence order. In
// reverse iteration, key/value pairs for identical user-keys are returned in
// ascending sequence order.
//
// InternalIterators provide 5 absolute positioning methods and 2 relative
// positioning methods. The absolute positioning methods are:
//
// - SeekGE
// - SeekPrefixGE
// - SeekLT
// - First
// - Last
//
// The relative positioning methods are:
//
// - Next
// - Prev
//
// The relative positioning methods can be used in conjunction with any of the
// absolute positioning methods with one exception: SeekPrefixGE does not
// support reverse iteration via Prev. It is undefined to call relative
// positioning methods without ever calling an absolute positioning method.
//
// InternalIterators can optionally implement a prefix iteration mode. This
// mode is entered by calling SeekPrefixGE and exited by any other absolute
// positioning method (SeekGE, SeekLT, First, Last). When in prefix iteration
// mode, a call to Next will advance to the next key which has the same
// "prefix" as the one supplied to SeekPrefixGE. Note that "prefix" in this
// context is not a strict byte prefix, but defined by byte equality for the
// result of the Comparer.Split method. An InternalIterator is not required to
// support prefix iteration mode, and can implement SeekPrefixGE by forwarding
// to SeekGE.
//
// Bounds, [lower, upper), can be set on iterators, either using the SetBounds()
// function in the interface, or in implementation specific ways during iterator
// creation. The forward positioning routines (SeekGE, First, and Next) only
// check the upper bound. The reverse positioning routines (SeekLT, Last, and
// Prev) only check the lower bound. It is up to the caller to ensure that the
// forward positioning routines respect the lower bound and the reverse
// positioning routines respect the upper bound (i.e. calling SeekGE instead of
// First if there is a lower bound, and SeekLT instead of Last if there is an
// upper bound). This imposition is done in order to elevate that enforcement to
// the caller (generally pebble.Iterator or pebble.mergingIter) rather than
// having it duplicated in every InternalIterator implementation.
//
// Additionally, the caller needs to ensure that SeekGE/SeekPrefixGE are not
// called with a key > the upper bound, and SeekLT is not called with a key <
// the lower bound. InternalIterator implementations are required to respect
// the iterator bounds, never returning records outside of the bounds with one
// exception: an iterator may generate synthetic RANGEDEL marker records. See
// levelIter.syntheticBoundary for the sole existing example of this behavior.
// Specifically, levelIter can return synthetic keys whose user key is equal to
// the lower/upper bound.
//
// The bounds provided to an internal iterator must remain valid until a
// subsequent call to SetBounds has returned. This requirement exists so that
// iterator implementations may compare old and new bounds to apply low-level
// optimizations. The pebble.Iterator satisfies this requirement by maintaining
// two bound buffers and switching between them.
//
// An iterator must be closed after use, but it is not necessary to read an
// iterator until exhaustion.
//
// An iterator is not goroutine-safe, but it is safe to use multiple iterators
// concurrently, either in separate goroutines or switching between the
// iterators in a single goroutine.
//
// It is also safe to use an iterator concurrently with modifying its
// underlying DB, if that DB permits modification. However, the resultant
// key/value pairs are not guaranteed to be a consistent snapshot of that DB
// at a particular point in time.
//
// InternalIterators accumulate errors encountered during operation, exposing
// them through the Error method. All of the absolute positioning methods
// reset any accumulated error before positioning. Relative positioning
// methods return without advancing if the iterator has accumulated an error.
