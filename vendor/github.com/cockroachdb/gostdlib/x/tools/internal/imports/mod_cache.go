// To find packages to import, the resolver needs to know about all of the
// the packages that could be imported. This includes packages that are
// already in modules that are in (1) the current module, (2) replace targets,
// and (3) packages in the module cache. Packages in (1) and (2) may change over
// time, as the client may edit the current module and locally replaced modules.
// The module cache (which includes all of the packages in (3)) can only
// ever be added to.
//
// The resolver can thus save state about packages in the module cache
// and guarantee that this will not change over time. To obtain information
// about new modules added to the module cache, the module cache should be
// rescanned.
//
// It is OK to serve information about modules that have been deleted,
// as they do still exist.
// TODO(suzmue): can we share information with the caller about
// what module needs to be downloaded to import this package?
