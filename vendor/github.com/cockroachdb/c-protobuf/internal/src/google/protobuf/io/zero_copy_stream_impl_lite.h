// This file contains common implementations of the interfaces defined in
// zero_copy_stream.h which are included in the "lite" protobuf library.
// These implementations cover I/O on raw arrays and strings, as well as
// adaptors which make it easy to implement streams based on traditional
// streams.  Of course, many users will probably want to write their own
// implementations of these interfaces specific to the particular I/O
// abstractions they prefer to use, but these should cover the most common
// cases.
