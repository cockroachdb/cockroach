## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another Facebook
open source project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull
request for the first time, just let us know that you have completed
the CLA and we can cross-check with your GitHub username.

Complete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>

If you prefer to sign a paper copy, we can send you a PDF.  Send us an 
e-mail or create a new github issue to request the CLA in PDF format.
