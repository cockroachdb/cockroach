// The Merge Operator
//
// Essentially, a MergeOperator specifies the SEMANTICS of a merge, which only
// client knows. It could be numeric addition, list append, string
// concatenation, edit data structure, ... , anything.
// The library, on the other hand, is concerned with the exercise of this
// interface, at the right time (during get, iteration, compaction...)
//
// To use merge, the client needs to provide an object implementing one of
// the following interfaces:
//  a) AssociativeMergeOperator - for most simple semantics (always take
//    two values, and merge them into one value, which is then put back
//    into rocksdb); numeric addition and string concatenation are examples;
//
//  b) MergeOperator - the generic class for all the more abstract / complex
//    operations; one method (FullMerge) to merge a Put/Delete value with a
//    merge operand; and another method (PartialMerge) that merges multiple
//    operands together. this is especially useful if your key values have
//    complex structures but you would still like to support client-specific
//    incremental updates.
//
// AssociativeMergeOperator is simpler to implement. MergeOperator is simply
// more powerful.
//
// Refer to rocksdb-merge wiki for more details and example implementations.
//

  //                   Client could multiplex the merge operator based on it
  //                   if the key space is partitioned and different subspaces
  //                   refer to different types of data which have different
  //                   merge operation semantics
  // existing: (IN)    null indicates that the key does not exist before this op
  // operand_list:(IN) the sequence of merge operations to apply, front() first.
  // new_value:(OUT)   Client is responsible for filling the merge result here.
  // The string that new_value is pointing to will be empty.
  // logger:   (IN)    Client could use this to log errors during merge.
  //
  // Return true on success.
  // All values passed in will be client-specific values. So if this method
  // returns false, it is because client specified bad data or there was

  // more effective to merge multiple operands at a time instead of two
  // operands at a time.
  //

  // leave new_value unchanged and return false. The library will
  // internally keep track of the operations, and apply them in the
  // correct order once a base-value (a Put/Delete/End-of-Database) is seen.

  // and simply "return false". For now, the client should simply return
  // false in any case it cannot perform partial-merge, regardless of reason.
