// Package rds provides the API client, operations, and parameter types for Amazon
// Relational Database Service.
//
// Amazon Relational Database Service Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon
// RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a
// relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable
// capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common
// database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes
// their applications and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the
// capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or
// Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code,
// applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work
// with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your
// database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance.
// Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and
// storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web
// Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources
// you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a
// programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon
// RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques
// such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been
// applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a
// command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the
// maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following
// some related topics from the user guide. Amazon RDS API Reference
