# Changelog

## v0.12.0

- feat: Automatic Release detection (#363, #369, #386, #400)
- fix: Do not change Hub.lastEventID for transactions (#379)
- fix: Do not clear LastEventID when events are dropped (#382)
- Updates to documentation (#366, #385)

_NOTE:_
This version drops support for Go 1.14, however no changes have been made that would make the SDK not work with Go 1.14. The currently supported Go versions are the last 3 stable releases: 1.15, 1.16 and 1.17.
There are two behavior changes related to `LastEventID`, both of which were intended to align the behavior of the Sentry Go SDK with other Sentry SDKs.
The new [automatic release detection feature](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/335) makes it easier to use Sentry and separate events per release without requiring extra work from users. We intend to improve this functionality in a future release by utilizing information that will be available in runtime starting with Go 1.18. The tracking issue is [#401](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/401).

## v0.11.0

  ([57123a40](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/commit/57123a409be55f61b1d5a6da93c176c55a399ad0), [#128](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/128), [#338](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/338), [#345](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/345), [#346](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/346), [#352](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/352), [#353](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/353), [#355](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/pull/355))

_NOTE:_
This version drops support for Go 1.13. The currently supported Go versions are the last 3 stable releases: 1.14, 1.15 and 1.16.
Users of the tracing functionality (`StartSpan`, etc) should upgrade to this version to benefit from separate rate limits for errors and transactions.
There are no breaking changes and upgrading should be a smooth experience for all users.

## v0.10.0

- feat: Debug connection reuse (#323)
- fix: Send root span data as `Event.Extra` (#329)
- fix: Do not double sample transactions (#328)
- fix: Do not override trace context of transactions (#327)
- fix: Drain and close API response bodies (#322)
- ci: Run tests against Go tip (#319)
- ci: Move away from Travis in favor of GitHub Actions (#314) (#321)

## v0.9.0

- feat: Initial tracing and performance monitoring support (#285)
- doc: Revamp sentryhttp documentation (#304)
- fix: Hub.PopScope never empties the scope stack (#300)
- ref: Report Event.Timestamp in local time (#299)
- ref: Report Breadcrumb.Timestamp in local time (#299)

_NOTE:_
This version introduces support for [Sentry's Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/go/performance/).
The new tracing capabilities are beta, and we plan to expand them on future versions. Feedback is welcome, please open new issues on GitHub.
The `sentryhttp` package got better API docs, an [updated usage example](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/tree/master/example/http) and support for creating automatic transactions as part of Performance Monitoring.

## v0.8.0

- build: Bump required version of Iris (#296)
- fix: avoid unnecessary allocation in Client.processEvent (#293)
- doc: Remove deprecation of sentryhttp.HandleFunc (#284)
- ref: Update sentryhttp example (#283)
- doc: Improve documentation of sentryhttp package (#282)
- doc: Clarify SampleRate documentation (#279)
- fix: Remove RawStacktrace (#278)
- docs: Add example of custom HTTP transport
- ci: Test against go1.15, drop go1.12 support (#271)

_NOTE:_
This version comes with a few updates. Some examples and documentation have been
improved. We've bumped the supported version of the Iris framework to avoid
LGPL-licensed modules in the module dependency graph.
The `Exception.RawStacktrace` and `Thread.RawStacktrace` fields have been
removed to conform to Sentry's ingestion protocol, only `Exception.Stacktrace`
and `Thread.Stacktrace` should appear in user code.

## v0.7.0

- feat: Include original error when event cannot be encoded as JSON (#258)
- feat: Use Hub from request context when available (#217, #259)
- feat: Extract stack frames from golang.org/x/xerrors (#262)
- feat: Make Environment Integration preserve existing context data (#261)
- feat: Recover and RecoverWithContext with arbitrary types (#268)
- feat: Report bad usage of CaptureMessage and CaptureEvent (#269)
- feat: Send debug logging to stderr by default (#266)
- feat: Several improvements to documentation (#223, #245, #250, #265)
- feat: Example of Recover followed by panic (#241, #247)
- feat: Add Transactions and Spans (to support OpenTelemetry Sentry Exporter) (#235, #243, #254)
- fix: Set either Frame.Filename or Frame.AbsPath (#233)
- fix: Clone requestBody to new Scope (#244)
- fix: Synchronize access and mutation of Hub.lastEventID (#264)
- fix: Avoid repeated syscalls in prepareEvent (#256)
- fix: Do not allocate new RNG for every event (#256)
- fix: Remove stale replace directive in go.mod (#255)
- fix(http): Deprecate HandleFunc, remove duplication (#260)

_NOTE:_
This version comes packed with several fixes and improvements and no breaking
changes.
Notably, there is a change in how the SDK reports file names in stack traces
that should resolve any ambiguity when looking at stack traces and using the
Suspect Commits feature.
We recommend all users to upgrade.

## v0.6.1

- fix: Use NewEvent to init Event struct (#220)

_NOTE:_
A change introduced in v0.6.0 with the intent of avoiding allocations made a
pattern used in official examples break in certain circumstances (attempting
to write to a nil map).
This release reverts the change such that maps in the Event struct are always
allocated.

## v0.6.0

- feat: Read module dependencies from runtime/debug (#199)
- feat: Support chained errors using Unwrap (#206)
- feat: Report chain of errors when available (#185)
- **[breaking]** fix: Accept http.RoundTripper to customize transport (#205)
  Before the SDK accepted a concrete value of type `*http.Transport` in
  `ClientOptions`, now it accepts any value implementing the `http.RoundTripper`
  interface. Note that `*http.Transport` implements `http.RoundTripper`, so most
  code bases will continue to work unchanged.
  Users of custom transport gain the ability to pass in other implementations of
  `http.RoundTripper` and may be able to simplify their code bases.
- fix: Do not panic when scope event processor drops event (#192)
- **[breaking]** fix: Use time.Time for timestamps (#191)
  Users of sentry-go typically do not need to manipulate timestamps manually.
  For those who do, the field type changed from `int64` to `time.Time`, which
  should be more convenient to use. The recommended way to get the current time
  is `time.Now().UTC()`.
- fix: Report usage error including stack trace (#189)
- feat: Add Exception.ThreadID field (#183)
- ci: Test against Go 1.14, drop 1.11 (#170)
- feat: Limit reading bytes from request bodies (#168)
- **[breaking]** fix: Rename fasthttp integration package sentryhttp => sentryfasthttp
  The current recommendation is to use a named import, in which case existing
  code should not require any change:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
  	"fmt"

  	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
  	sentryfasthttp "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/fasthttp"
  	"github.com/valyala/fasthttp"
  )
  ```

_NOTE:_
This version includes some new features and a few breaking changes, none of
which should pose troubles with upgrading. Most code bases should be able to
upgrade without any changes.

## v0.5.1

- fix: Ignore err.Cause() when it is nil (#160)

## v0.5.0

- fix: Synchronize access to HTTPTransport.disabledUntil (#158)
- docs: Update Flush documentation (#153)
- fix: HTTPTransport.Flush panic and data race (#140)

_NOTE:_
This version changes the implementation of the default transport, modifying the
behavior of `sentry.Flush`. The previous behavior was to wait until there were
no buffered events; new concurrent events kept `Flush` from returning. The new
behavior is to wait until the last event prior to the call to `Flush` has been
sent or the timeout; new concurrent events have no effect. The new behavior is
inline with the [Unified API
Guidelines](https://docs.sentry.io/development/sdk-dev/unified-api/).

We have updated the documentation and examples to clarify that `Flush` is meant
to be called typically only once before program termination, to wait for
in-flight events to be sent to Sentry. Calling `Flush` after every event is not
recommended, as it introduces unnecessary latency to the surrounding function.
Please verify the usage of `sentry.Flush` in your code base.

- feat: Move frames context reading into `contextifyFramesIntegration` (#28)

_NOTE:_
In case of any performance issues due to source contexts IO, you can let us know and turn off the integration in the meantime with:

```go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Integrations: func(integrations []sentry.Integration) []sentry.Integration {
		var filteredIntegrations []sentry.Integration
		for _, integration := range integrations {
			if integration.Name() == "ContextifyFrames" {
