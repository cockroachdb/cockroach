// Time series keys are carefully constructed to usefully sort the data in the
// key-value store for the purpose of queries. Time series data is queryied by
// providing a series name and a timespan; we therefore expose the series name
// and the collection time prominently on the key.
//
// The precise formula for a time series key is:
//
//   [system key prefix]tsd[series name][resolution][time slot][source key]
//
// The series name is an arbitrary string identifying the series, although the
// ts system may enforce naming rules at a higher level. This string is binary
// encoded in the key.
//
// The source key is a possibly empty string which identifies the source from
// which the series data was gathered. Data for a series may be gathered from
// multiple sources, which are stored separately but are sorted adjacently for
// efficient access.
//
// The resolution refers to the sample duration at which data is stored.
// Cockroach supports a fixed set of named resolutions, which are stored in the
// Resolution enumeration. This value is encoded as a VarInt in the key.
//
// Cockroach divides all data for a series into contiguous "time slots" of
// uniform length based on the "key duration" of the Resolution. For each
// series/source pair, there will be one key per slot. Slot 0 begins at unix
// epoch; the slot for a specific timestamp is found by truncating the
// timestamp to an exact multiple of the key duration, and then dividing it by
// the key duration:
//
// 		slot := (timestamp / keyDuration) // integer division
