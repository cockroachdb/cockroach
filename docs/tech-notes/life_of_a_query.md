# Life of a SQL Query

Original author: Andrei Matei

## Introduction

This document aims to explain the execution of an SQL query against
CockroachDB, explaining the code paths through the various layers of
the system (network protocol, SQL session management, parsing,
execution planning, syntax tree transformations, query running,
interface with the KV code, routing of KV requests, request
processing, Raft, on-disk storage engine). The idea is to provide a
high-level unifying view of the structure of the various components;
no one will be explored in particular depth but pointers to other
documentation will be provided where such documentation exists. Code
pointers will abound.

This document will generally not discuss design decisions; it will
rather focus on tracing through the actual (current) code.

The intended audience for this post is folks curious about a dive
through the architecture of a modern, albeit young, database presented
differently than in a [design
doc](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md). It
will hopefully also be helpful for open source contributors and new
Cockroach Labs engineers.

## Limitations

This document does not cover some important aspects of query execution,
in particular major developments that have occurred after the document
was initially authored; including but not limited to:

- how are transaction and SQL session timestamps assigned
- proposer-evaluated KV
- concurrent statement execution inside a SQL transaction
- 1PC optimizations for UPDATE and INSERT
- column families
- composite encoding for collated strings and DECIMAL values in PK and indexes
- txn contention handling via pusher queues

## Postgres Wire Protocol

A SQL query arrives at the server through the Postgres wire protocol
(CockroachDB speaks the Postgres protocol for compatibility with
existing client drivers and applications). The `pgwire` package
implements protocol-related functionality; once a client connection is
authenticated, it is represented by a
[`pgwire.v3Conn`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/pgwire/v3.go#L164)
struct (it wraps a [`net.Conn`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn)
interface - Go's
sockets). [`v3Conn.serve()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/pgwire/v3.go#L313)
implements the "read query - execute it - return result" loop. The
protocol is message-oriented: for the lifetime of the connection, we
[read a
message](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b/pkg/sql/pgwire/v3.go#L324)
usually representing one or more SQL statements, pass it to the
`sql.Executor` for executing all the statements in the batch and, once
that's done and the results have been produced, [serialize them and
send them to the
client](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b/pkg/sql/pgwire/v3.go#L755).

Notice that the results are not streamed to the client and, moreover, a whole batch of statements might be executed before any results are sent back.

## SQL Executor

The
[`sql.Executor`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L194)
is responsible for parsing statements, executing them and returning
results back to the `pgwire.v3Conn`. The main entry point is
[`Executor.execRequest()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/executor.go#L481),
which receives a batch of statements as a raw `string`. The execution
of the batch is done in the context of a
[`sql.Session`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/session.go#L61)
object which accumulates information about the state of the connection
(e.g. the database that has been selected, the various variables that
can be set, the transaction status), as well as accounting the memory
in use at any given time by this connection. The `Executor` also
manipulates a
[`planner`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/planner.go#L39)
struct which provides the functionality around actually planning and
executing a query.

`Executor.execRequest()` implements a state-machine of sorts by
receiving batches of statements from `pgwire`, executing them one by
one, updating the `Session`'s transaction state (did a new transaction
just begin or an old transaction just end? did we encounter an error
which forces us to abort the current transaction?) and returning
results and control back to pgwire. The next batch of statements
received from the client will continue from the transaction state left
by the previous batch.

### Parsing

The first thing the `Executor` does is [parse the
statements](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/executor.go#L495);
parsing uses a LALR parser generated by `go-yacc` from a [Yacc-like grammar
file](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/parser/sql.y),
originally copied from Postgres and stripped down, and then gradually
grown organically with ever-more SQL support. The process of parsing
transforms a `string` into an array of ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees),
one for each statement. The AST nodes are structs defined in the
`sql/parser` package, generally of two types - statements and
expressions. Expressions implement a common interface useful for
applying tree transformations. These ASTs will later be transformed by
the `planner` into an execution plan.

### Statement Execution

With a list of statements in hand, `Executor.execRequest()` goes
through them in order and executes one transaction's worth of
statements at a time (i.e. groups of statements between a `BEGIN` and
`COMMIT/ROLLBACK` statements, or single statements executed outside of
a transaction). If the session had an open transaction after execution
of the previous batch, we continue consuming statements until a
`COMMIT/ROLLBACK`. This "consuming of statements" is done by the call
to
[`runTxnAttempt`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/executor.go#L587);
this function returns after executing statements until the
`COMMIT/ROLLBACK` has been encountered.

There is an impedance mismatch that has to be explained here, around
the interfacing of the SQL `Executor/session` code, which is
stream-oriented (with statements being executed one at a time possibly
within the scope of SQL transactions) and CockroachDB's Key/Value (KV)
interface, which is request oriented with transactions explicitly
attached to every request. The most interesting interface for the KV
layer of the database is the
[`Txn.Exec()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/txn.go#L465)
method. `Txn` lives in the `internal/client` package, which contains
the KV client interface (the "client" and the server in this context
are both internal to CockroachDB, although we used to expose the KV
interface externally in the past and it's not out of the question that
we'll do it again in the future). `Txn` represents a KV transaction;
there's generally one associated with the SQL session, reused between
client ping-pongs.

The `Txn.Exec` interface takes a callback and some execution options
and, based on those options, executes the callback possibly multiple
times and commits the transaction afterwards. If allowed by the
options, the callback might be called multiple times, to deal with
retries of transactions that are [sometimes
necessary](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions.html#transaction-retries)
in CockroachDB (usually because of data contention). The SQL
`Executor` might or might not want to let the KV client perform such
retries automatically.

To hint at the complications: a single SQL
statement executed outside of a SQL transaction (i.e. an "implicit
transaction") can be safely retried. However, a SQL transaction
spanning multiple client requests will have different statements
executed in different callbacks passed to `Txn.Exec()`; as such, it is
not sufficient to retry one of these callbacks - we have to retry all
the statements in the transaction, and generally some of these
statements might be conditional on the client's logic and thus cannot
be retried verbatim (i.e. different results for a `SELECT` might
trigger different subsequent statements). In this case, we bubble up a
retryable error to the client; more details about this can be read in
our [transaction
documentation](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/transactions.html#client-side-intervention). This
complexity is captured in
[`Executor.execRequest()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L495),
which has logic for setting the different execution options and
contains a [suitable
callback](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L604)
[passed to
`Txn.Exec()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L643);
this callback will call
[`runTxnAttempt()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L621). The
statement execution code path continues inside the callback, but it is
worth noting that, from this moment on, we have interfaced with the
(client of the) KV layer and everything below is executing in the
context of a KV transaction.

### Building execution plans

Now that we have figured out what (KV) transaction we're running inside
of, we are concerned with executing SQL statements one at a
time. `runTxnAttempt()` has a few layers below it dealing with the
various states a SQL transaction can be in
([open](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L966s)
/
[aborted](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L887)
/ [waiting for a user
retry](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/executor.go#L944),
etc.), but the interesting one is
[execStmt](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/executor.go#L1258). This
guy [creates an "execution
plan"](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/677f6f18b63355cb2d040b251af202fe6505128f/pkg/sql/executor.go#L1261)
for a statement and runs it.

An execution plan in CockroachDB is a tree of
[`planNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad/pkg/sql/plan.go#L72)
nodes, similar in spirit to the AST but, this time, containing
semantic information and also runtime state. This tree is built by
[`planner.makePlan()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/plan.go#L199),
which takes a parsed statement and returns the root of the `planNode`
tree after having performed all the semantic analysis and various
transformations. The nodes in this tree are actually "executable"
(they have `Start()` and `Next()` methods), and each one will consume
data produced by its children (e.g. a `JoinNode` has [`left and
right`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/join.go#L125)
children whose data it consumes).

Currently building the execution plan, performing semantic analysis
and applying various transformations is a pretty ad-hoc process, but
we are working on replacing the code with a more structured process and
separating the IR (Intermediate Representation) used for analysis and
transforms from the runtime structures (see this WIP
RFC)[https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/10055/files#diff-542aa8b21b245d1144c920577333ceed].

In the meantime, the `planner` [looks at the type of the
statement](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/plan.go#L248)
at the top of the AST and, for each statement type, invokes a specific
method that builds the execution plan. For example, the tree for a
`SELECT` statement is produced by
[`planner.SelectClause()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/select.go#L257). Notice
how different aspects of a `SELECT` statement are handled there: a
`scanNode` is created
(`renderNode.initFrom()`->...->
[`planner.Scan()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/data_source.go#L441))
to scan a table, a `WHERE` clause is transformed into an expression
and assigned to a
`filterNode`,
an `ORDER BY` clause is [turned into a
`sortNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/select.go#L296),
etc. In the end, a
[`selectTopNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/select.go#L320)
is produced, which in fact is a tree of a `groupNode`, a `windowNode`,
a `sortNode`, a `distinctNode` and a `renderNode` wrapping a
`scanNode` acting as an original data source).

Finally, the execution plan is simplified and optimized somewhat; this
includes removing the `selectTopNode` wrappers and eliding all no-op
intermediate nodes.

To make this notion of the execution plan more concrete, consider one
actually "rendered" by the `EXPLAIN` statement:

```sql
root@:26257> create table customers(
name string primary key,
address string,
state string,
index SI (state)
);

root@:26257> insert into customers values
('Google', '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway', 'CA'),
('Apple', '1 Infinite Loop', 'CA'),
('IBM', '1 New Orchard Road ', 'NY');

root@:26257> EXPLAIN(EXPRS,NOEXPAND,NOOPTIMIZE,METADATA) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address like '%Infinite%' ORDER BY state;
+-------+--------+----------+---------------------------+------------------------+----------+
| Level |  Type  |  Field   |        Description        |        Columns         | Ordering |
+-------+--------+----------+---------------------------+------------------------+----------+
|     0 | select |          |                           | (name, address, state) | +state   |
|     1 | nosort |          |                           | (name, address, state) | +state   |
|     1 |        | order    | +@3                       |                        |          |
|     1 | render |          |                           | (name, address, state) |          |
|     1 |        | render 0 | name                      |                        |          |
|     1 |        | render 1 | address                   |                        |          |
|     1 |        | render 2 | state                     |                        |          |
|     2 | filter |          |                           | (name, address, state) |          |
|     2 |        | filter   | address LIKE '%Infinite%' |                        |          |
|     3 | scan   |          |                           | (name, address, state) |          |
|     3 |        | table    | customers@primary         |                        |          |
+-------+--------+----------+---------------------------+------------------------+----------+
```

You can see data being produced by a `scanNode`, being filtered by a
`filterNode` (presented as "filter"), and then sorted by a `sortNode`
(presented as "nosort", because we have turned off order analysis with
NOEXPAND and the sort node doesn't know yet whether sorting is
needed), wrapped in a `selectTopNode` (presented as "select").

With plan simplification turned on, the EXPLAIN output becomes:

```
root@:26257> EXPLAIN (EXPRS,METADATA) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE address LIKE '%Infinite%' ORDER BY state;
+-------+------+--------+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------+
| Level | Type | Field  |        Description        |        Columns         |   Ordering   |
+-------+------+--------+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------+
|     0 | sort |        |                           | (name, address, state) | +state       |
|     0 |      | order  | +state                    |                        |              |
|     1 | scan |        |                           | (name, address, state) | +name,unique |
|     1 |      | table  | customers@primary         |                        |              |
|     1 |      | spans  | ALL                       |                        |              |
|     1 |      | filter | address LIKE '%Infinite%' |                        |              |
+-------+------+--------+---------------------------+------------------------+--------------+
```

#### Expressions

A subset of ASTs are
[`parser.Expr`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/parser/expr.go#L25),
representing various "expressions" - parts of statements that can
occur in many various places - in a `WHERE` clause, in a `LIMIT`
clause, in an `ORDER BY` clause, as the projections of a `SELECT`
statement, etc. Expressions nodes implement a common interface so that
a [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) can
be applied to them for different transformations and
analysis. Regardless of where they appear in the query, all
expressions need some common processing (e.g. names appearing in them
need to be resolved to columns from data sources). These tasks are
performed by
[`planner.analyzeExpr`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/analyze.go#L1596). Each
`planNode` is responsible for calling `analyzeExpr` on the expressions
it contains, usually at node creation time (again, we hope to unify
our execution planning more in the future).

`planner.analyzeExpr` performs the following tasks:

1. resolving names (the `colA` in `select 3 * colA from MyTable` needs
   to be replaced by an index within the rows produced by the underlying
   data source (usually a `scanNode`))
2. normalization (e.g. `a = 1 + 1` -> `a = 2`, ` a not between b and c` -> `(a < b) or (a > c)`)
3. type checking (see [the typing
   RFC](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/RFCS/20160203_typing.md)
   for an in-depth discussion of Cockroach's typing system).

   1. constant folding (e.g. `1 + 2` becomes `3`): we perform exact
      arithmetic using [the same library used by the Go
      compiler](https://golang.org/pkg/go/constant/) and classify all the
      constants into two categories: [numeric -
      `NumVal`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/parser/constant.go#L108)
      or [string-like -
      `StrVal`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/parser/constant.go#L281). These
      representations of the constants are smart enough to figure out the
      set of types that can represent the value
      (e.g. [`NumVal.AvailableTypes`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/parser/constant.go#L188)
      - `5` can be represented as `int, decimal or float`, but `5.4` can
      only be represented as `decimal or float`) This will come in useful
      in the next step.

   2. type inference and propagation: this analysis phase assigns a
      result type to an expression, and in the process types all the
      sub-expressions. Typed expressions are represented by the
      [`TypedExpr`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/parser/expr.go#L48)
      interface, and they are finally able to evaluate themselves to a
      result value through the `Eval` method. The typing algorithm is
      presented in detail in the typing RFC: the general idea is that
      it's a recursive algorithm operating on sub-expressions; each level
      of the recursion may take a hint about the desired outcome, and
      each expression node takes that hint into consideration while
      weighting what options it has. In the absence of a hint, there's
      also a set of "natural typing" rules. For example, a `NumVal`
      described above
      [checks](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/parser/constant.go#L61)
      whether the hint is compatible with its list of possible
      types. This process also deals with [`overload
      resolution`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/parser/type_check.go#L371)
      for function calls and operators.
4. replacing sub-query syntax nodes by a `sql.subquery` execution plan
   node.

A note about sub-queries: consider a query like `select * from
Employees where DepartmentID in (select DepartmentID from Departments
where NumEmployees > 100)`. The query on the `Departments` table is
called a sub-query. Subqueries are recognized and replaced with an
execution node by
[`subqueryVisitor`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/subquery.go#L294). The
subqueries are then run and replaced by their results through the
[`subqueryPlanVisitor`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/subquery.go#L194). This
is usually done by various top-level nodes when they start execution
(e.g. `renderNode.Start()`).

### Notable `planNodes`

As hinted throughout, execution plan nodes are responsible for
executing parts of a query. Each one consumes data from lower-level
nodes, performs some logic, and feeds data into a higher-level one.

After being constructed, their main methods are
[`Start`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/plan.go#L142),
which initiates the processing, and
[`Next`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/a83c960a0547720a3179e05eb54ea5b67d107d10/pkg/sql/plan.go#L149),
which is called repeatedly to produce the next row.

To tie this to the [SQL Executor](#sql-executor) section above,
`executor.execLocal()`,
the method responsible for executing one statement, calls
`plan.Next()` repeatedly and accumulates the results.

Consider some `planNode`s involved in running a `SELECT`
statement, using the table defined above and

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE State LIKE 'C%' AND strpos(address, 'Infinite') != 0 ORDER BY Name;
```

as a slightly contrived example. This is supposed to return customers
from states starting with "C" and whose address contains the string
"Infinite". To get excited, let's see the query plan for this
statement:

```sql
root@:26257> EXPLAIN(EXPRS) SELECT * FROM customers WHERE State LIKE 'C%' and strpos(address, 'Infinite') != 0 order by name;
+-------+------------+--------+----------------------------------+
| Level |    Type    | Field  |           Description            |
+-------+------------+--------+----------------------------------+
|     0 | sort       |        |                                  |
|     0 |            | order  | +name                            |
|     1 | index-join |        |                                  |
|     2 | scan       |        |                                  |
|     2 |            | table  | customers@SI                     |
|     2 |            | spans  | /"C"-/"D"                        |
|     2 |            | filter | state LIKE 'C%'                  |
|     2 | scan       |        |                                  |
|     2 |            | table  | customers@primary                |
|     2 |            | filter | strpos(address, 'Infinite') != 0 |
+-------+------------+--------+----------------------------------+
```

So the plan produced for this query, from top (highest-level) to
bottom, looks like:

```
sortNode -> indexJoinNode -> scanNode (index)
			  -> scanNode (PK)
```

Before we inspect the nodes in turn, one thing deserves explanation:
how did the `indexJoinNode` (which indicates that the query is going
to use the "SI" index) come to be? The fact that this query uses an
index is not apparent in the syntactical structure of the `SELECT`
statement, and so this plan is not simply a product of the mechanical
tree building hinted to above. Indeed, there's a step that we haven't
mentioned before: ["plan
expansion"](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/expand_plan.go#L28). Among
other things, this step performs "index selection" (more information
about the algorithms currently used for index selection can be found
in [Radu's blog
post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/index-selection-cockroachdb-2/)). We're
looking for indexes that can be scanned to efficiently retrieve only
rows that match (part of) the filter. In our case, the "SI" index
(indexing the state) can be scanned to efficiently retrieve only the
rows that are candidates for satisfying the `state LIKE 'C%'`
expression (in an ecstasy to agony moment, we see that our index
selection / expression normalization code [is smart
enough](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/analyze.go#L1436)
to infer that `state LIKE 'C%'` implies `state >= 'C' AND state <
'D'`, but is not smart enough to infer that the two expressions are in
fact equivalent and thus the filter can be elided altogether). We
won't go into plan expansion or index selection here, but the index
selection process happens [in the expansion of the
`SelectNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/expand_plan.go#L283)
and, as a byproduct, produces `indexJoinNode`s configured with the
index spans to be scanned.

Now let's see how these `planNode`s run:

1. [`sortNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sort.go#L31):
   The `sortNode` sorts the rows produced by its child and corresponds to
   the `ORDER BY` SQL clause. The
   [constructor](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sort.go#L60)
   has a bunch of logic related to the quirky rules for name resolution
   from SQL92/99. Another interesting fact is that, if we're sorting by a
   non-trivial expression (e.g. `SELECT a, b ... ORDER BY a + b`), we
   need the `a + b` values (for every row) to be produced by a
   lower-level node. This is achieved through a pattern that's also
   present in other node: the lower node capable of evaluating
   expressions and rendering their results is the `renderNode`; the
   `sortNode` constructor checks if the expressions it needs are already
   rendered by that node and, if they are not, asks for them to be
   produced through the
   [`renderNode.addOrMergeRenders()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sort.go#L206)
   method.  The actual sorting is performed in the `sortNode.Next()`
   method. The first time it is called, [it consumes all the data
   produced by the child
   node](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sort.go#L359)
   and accumulates it into `n.sortStrategy` (an interface hiding multiple
   sorting algorithms). When the last row is consumed,
   `n.sortStrategy.Finish()` is called, at which time the sorting
   algorithm finishes its processing. Subsequent calls to
   `sortNode.Next()` simply iterate through the results of sorting
   algorithm.

2. [`indexJoinNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/index_join.go#L30):
   The `indexJoinNode` implements joining of results from an index with
   the rows of a table. It is used when an index can be used for a query,
   but it doesn't contain all the necessary columns; columns not
   available in the index need to be retrieved from the Primary Key (PK)
   key-values. The `indexJoinNode` sits on top of two scan nodes - one
   configured to scan the index, and one that is constantly reconfigured
   to do "point lookups" by PK. In the case of our query, we can see that
   the "SI" index is used to read a compact set of rows that match the
   "state" filter but, since it doesn't contain the "address" columns,
   the PK also needs to be used. Each index KV pair contains the primary
   key of the row, so there is enough information to do PK
   lookups. [`indexJoinNode.Next`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/index_join.go#L273)
   keeps reading rows from the index and, for each one, adds a spans to
   be read by the PK. Once enough such spans have been batched, they are
   all [read from the
   PK](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/index_join.go#L257). As
   described in the section on [SQL rows to KV
   pairs](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#data-mapping-between-the-sql-model-and-kv))
   from the design doc, each SQL row is represented as a single KV pair
   in the indexes, but as multiple consecutive rows in the PK
   (represented by a "key span").

   An interesting detail has to do with
   how filters are handled: note that the `state LIKE 'C%'` condition is
   evaluated by the index scan, and the `strpos(address, 'Infinite') !=
   0` condition is evaluated by the PK scan. This is nice because it
   means that we will be filtering as much as we can on the index side and
   we will be doing fewer expensive PK lookups. The code that figures out
   which conjunction is to be evaluated where is in `splitFilter()`,
   called by the [`indexJoinNode`
   constructor](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/index_join.go#L180).

3. [`scanNode`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/scan.go#L33):
   The `scanNode` generally constitutes the source of a `renderNode` or `filterNode`;
   it is responsible for scanning over the key/value pairs for a table or
   index and reconstructing them into rows. This node is starting to
   smell like rubber meeting a road, because we are getting closer to the
   actual data - the monolithic, distributed KV map. You'll see that the
   [`Next()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/scan.go#L214)
   method is not particularly climactic, since it delegates the work to a
   `rowFetcher`, described below. There's one interesting thing that the
   `scanNode` does: it [runs a filter
   expression](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/scan.go#L233),
   just like the `filterNode`. That is because we are trying to push down
   parts of the `WHERE` clause as far as possible. This is generally a
   work in progress, see `filter_opt.go`. The idea is
   that a query like
```sql
/* Select the orders placed by each customer in the first year of membership. */
SELECT * FROM Orders o inner join Customers c ON o.CustomerID = c.ID WHERE Orders.amount > 10 AND Customers.State = 'NY' AND age(c.JoinDate, o.Date) < INTERVAL '1 year'
```
   is going to be compiled into two `scanNode`s, one for `Customers`,
   one for `Orders`. Each one of them can do the part of filtering
   that refers exclusively to their respective tables, and then the
   higher-level `joinNode` only needs to evaluate expressions that
   need data from both (i.e. `age(c.JoinDate, o.Date) < INTERVAL '1
   year'`).

   Let's continue downwards, looking at the structures that the
   `scanNode` uses for actually reading data.

   1. [`rowFetcher`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/rowfetcher.go#L35):
      The `rowFetcher` is responsible for iterating through key-value
      pairs, figuring out where a SQL table or index row ends (remember
      that a SQL row is potentially encoded in multiple KV entries), and
      decoding all the keys and values in SQL column values, dealing with
      differences between the primary index and other indexes and with
      the [layout of a
      table](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/column-families.html). For
      details on the mapping between SQL rows and KV pairs, see the
      [corresponding section from the Design
      Doc](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#data-mapping-between-the-sql-model-and-kv) and the [encoding tech note](encoding.md).

      The `rowFetcher` also [performs
      decoding](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/table.go#L953)
      from on-disk byte arrays to the representation of data that we do
      most processing on: implementation of the
      [`parser.Datum`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/parser/datum.go#L57)
      interface. For details on what the on-disk format is for different
      data types, browse around the [`util/encoding
      directory`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/util/encoding).

      For actually reading a KV pair from the database, the `rowFetcher` delegates to the `kvBatchFetcher`.

   2. [`kvBatchFetcher`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/kvfetcher.go#L84):
      The `kvBatchFetcher` finally reads data from the KV database. It
      understands nothing of SQL concepts, such as tables, rows or
      columns. When it is created, it is configured with a number of "key
      spans" that it needs to read (these might be, for example, a single
      span for reading a whole table, or a couple of spans for reading
      parts of the PK or of an index).

      To actually read data from the KV database, the `kvBatchFetcher` uses the
      KV layer's "client" interface, namely
      [`client.Batch`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/batch.go#L30). This
      is where the "SQL layer" interfaces with the "KV layer" - the
      `kvBatchFetcher` will
      [build](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/kvfetcher.go#L197)
      such `Batch`es of requests, [send them for
      execution](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/kvfetcher.go#L203)
      in the context of the KV transaction (remember the `Transaction`
      mentioned in the [Statement Execution
      section](#StatementExecution)), [read the
      results](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/sql/sqlbase/kvfetcher.go#L220)
      and return them to the hierarchy of `planNodes`. The requests being
      sent to the KV layer, in the case of this read-only query, are
      [`ScanRequest`s](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L204).

The rest of this document will walk through the "execution" of KV
requests, such as the ones sent by the `kvBatchFetcher`.

## KV

The KV layer of CockroachDB deals with execution of "requests". The
protocol-buffer-based API is defined in
[api.proto](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto),
listing the various types of requests and response. In practice, the
KV's client always sends
[`BatchRequest`s](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L848),
a generic request containing a collection of other requests. All
requests have a
[Header](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L788)
which contains routing information (which replica a request is
destined for) and [transaction
information](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L818)
- in the context of which transaction is the request to be executed.

### The KV client interface

Clients "send" KV requests using a client interface (currently this
interface is internal, used by SQL, but we might offer it directly to
users in some form in the future). This client interface contains
primitives for [starting a (KV)
transaction](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/db.go#L452)
(remember, the SQL `Executor` uses this to run every statement in the
context of a transaction). Afterwards, a
[`Txn`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/txn.go#L36)
object is available for [executing requests in the context of that
transaction](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/txn.go#L295)
- this is what, for example, the `kvBatchFetcher` uses. If you trace what
happens inside that `Txn.Run()` method you eventually get to
[`txn.db.sender.Send(...,
batch)`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/txn.go#L587):
the request starts percolating through a hierarchy of
[`Sender`s](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/internal/client/sender.go#L27)
- objects that perform various peripheral tasks and ultimately route
the request to a replica for execution. `Sender`s have a single method
- `Send()` - which ultimately passes the request to the lower
level. Let's go down this "sending" rabbit hole: `TxnCoordSender ->
DistSender -> Node -> Stores -> Store -> Replica`. The first two run
on the same node as the that received the SQL query and is doing the
SQL processing (the "gateway node"), the others run on the nodes
responsible for the data that is being accessed (the "range node").

### TxnCoordSender

The top-most `client.Sender` is the
[`TxnCoordSender`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/txn_coord_sender.go#L140). A
TxnCoordSender is responsible for dealing with transactions' state
(see the [Transaction Management section of the design
doc](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md)). After
a transaction is started, the TxnCoordSender starts asynchronously
sending heartbeat messages to that transaction's "txn record", to keep
it live. It also keeps track of each written key or key range over the
course of the transaction. When the transaction is committed or
aborted, it clears accumulated write intents for the transaction. All
requests being performed as part of a transaction have to go through
the same `TxnCoordSender` so that all write intents are accounted for
and eventually cleaned up.  After performing this bookkeeping, the
request is [passed to the
`DistSender`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/txn_coord_sender.go#L418).

### DistSender

The
[`DistSender`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L133)
is truly a workhorse: it handles the communication between the gateway
node and the (possibly many) range nodes, putting the "distributed" in
"distributed database". It receives `BatchRequest`s, looks at the
requests inside the batch, figures out what range each command needs
to go to, finds the nodes/replicas responsible for that range, routes
the requests there and then collects and reassembles the results.

Let's go through the code a bit:

1. The request is subdivided into ranges: `DistSender.Send()` calls
   [`DistSender.divideAndSendBatchToRanges()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L620)
   which
   [iterates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L720)
   over the constituent ranges of requests by using a
   [`RangeIterator`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_iter.go#L27)
   (a single request, such as a `ScanRequest` can refer to a key span
   that might straddle potentially many ranges). A lot of things hide
   behind this innocent-looking iteration: the cluster's range metadata
   needs to be accessed in order to find the mapping of keys to ranges
   (info on this metadata can be found [in the Range Metadata
   section](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#range-metadata)
   of the design doc). Range metadata is stored as regular data in the
   cluster, in a two-level index mapping range end keys to descriptors
   about the replicas of the respective range (the ranges storing this
   index are called "meta-ranges"). The `RangeIterator` logically
   iterates over these descriptors, in range key order. Brace yourselves:
   for moving from one range to the next, the iterator [calls back into
   the
   `DistSender`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_iter.go#L156),
   which knows how to find the descriptor of the range responsible for
   one particular key. The `DistSender`
   [delegates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L441)
   resolving a key to a descriptor to the
   [`rangeDescriptorCache`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_cache.go#L76)
   (a LRU tree cache, indexed by range end key). This cache
   desynchronized with reality as ranges in a cluster split or move
   around; when an entry is discovered to be stale, we'll see below that
   the `DistSender` removes it from the cache.

   In the happy case, the cache has information about a descriptor
   covering the key we're interested in and [it returns
   it](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_cache.go#L295). In
   the unhappy case, it needs to [perform a
   scan](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_cache.go#L323)
   of a meta-range. To do so, we need to know the descriptor of the
   meta-range containing the descriptor we're interested in, which is
   retrieved using [a recursive call into the
   cache](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_cache.go#L431). This
   recursion cannot go on forever - the descriptor of a regular range is
   in a meta2-range (a 2nd level index range), and the descriptors for
   meta2-ranges are present in the (one and only) meta1-range. Once the
   meta-descriptor of the range we want to scan is known, the cache
   [delegates back again to the
   `DistSender`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/range_cache.go#L439),
   which [sends a
   `RangeLookupRequest`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L305)
   KV command addressed directly to the meta range (so the `DistSender`
   is not recursively involved in routing this request).

2. Each sub-request (partial batch) is sent to its range. This is done
   through the call to
   [`DistSender.sendPartialBatchAsync()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L793)
   which
   [truncates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L894)
   all the requests in the batch to the current range and then it
   [sends](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L926)
   the truncated batch to a range. All these partial batches are sent
   concurrently.

   `sendPartialBatch()` is the level at which error stemming from stale
   `rangeDescriptorCache` information are handled: the range descriptor
   that's detected to be stale is
   [evicted](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L974)
   from the cache and the partial batch is
   [reprocessed](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L982).

3. Sending a partial batch to a single range implies selecting the
   right replica of that range and performing an RPC to it. By default,
   each range is replicated three ways, but only one of the three
   replicas is the "lease holder" - the temporarily designed owner of
   that range, in charge of coordinating all reads and writes to it (see
   the [Range Leases
   section](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#range-leases)
   in the design doc). Figuring out which replica has the lease is done
   through another cache - the
   [`leaseHolderCache`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/leaseholder_cache.go#L28),
   whose information can also get stale.

   The method of the `DistSender` dealing with this is
   [`sendSingleRange`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L451). It
   will use the cache to send the request to the lease holder, but it's
   also prepared to try the other replicas, in [order of
   "proximity"](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L461). The
   replica that the cache says is the leaseholder is simply [moved to the
   front](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L467)
   of the list of replicas to be tried and then an [RPC is
   sent](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L474)
   to all of them, in order.

4. Sending the RPCs is initiated by
   [`sendToReplicas`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L1095),
   which sends the request to the [first
   one](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L1136)
   and subsequently to [the
   other](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L1234),
   until one succeeds or returns a processing error. Processing errors
   are distinguished from routing errors by
   [`handlePerReplicaError`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L1258)
   which, among others, handles [wrong information in the
   `leaseHolderCache`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L1273).

5. Actually sending the RPCs is hidden behind the [`Transport
   interface`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/transport.go#L87). Concretely,
   [`grpcTransport.SendNext()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/transport.go#L159)
   does [gRPC](http://www.grpc.io/) calls to the nodes containing the
   destination replicas, namely to a service implementing the [`Internal`
   service](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L892).

6. The (async) responses from the different replicas are
   [combined](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/kv/dist_sender.go#L691)
   into a single `BatchResponse`, which is ultimately returned from the
   `Send()` method.

We've now gone through the relevant things that happen on the gateway
node. Further, we're going to look at what happens on the "remote"
side - on each of the ranges.

### RPC server - Node and Stores

We've seen how the `DistSender` splits `BatchRequest` into partial
batches, each containing commands local to a single replica, and how
these commands are sent to the lease holders of their ranges through
RPCs. We're now moving to the "server" end of these RPCs. The struct
that implements the RPC service is
[`Node`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/server/node.go#L850). The
`Node` doesn't do anything of great relevance; it
[delegates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/server/node.go#L825)
the request to its
[`Stores`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/stores.go#L36)
member which represents a collection of "stores" (on-disk databases
imagined to be one per physical disk, see [the Architecture
section](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#architecture)
of the design doc). The `Stores` implements the `Sender` interface,
just like the gateway layers that we've seen before, resuming the
pattern of wrapping another `Sender` and passing requests down through
the `Send()` method.

`Stores.Send()`
[identifies](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/stores.go#L160)
which particular store contains the destination replica (based on
routing info filled into the request by the `DistSender`) and
[routes](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/stores.go#L187)
the request there. One interesting thing that the `Stores` does, in
case requests from the current transactions have already been
processed on this node, is [update the upper
bound](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/stores.go#L166)
on the uncertainty interval to be used by the current request (see the
["Choosing a Timestamp" section of the design
doc](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md))
for details on uncertainty intervals). The uncertainty interval
dictates which timestamps for values are ambiguous because of clock
skew between nodes (the values for which don't know if they were
written before or after the serialization point of the current
txn). This code realizes that, if a request from the current txn has
been processed on this node before, no value written after that node's
timestamp at the time of that other request processing is ambiguous.

### Store - intent resolution

A
[`Store`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L366)
represents one physical disk device. For our purposes, a `Store`
mostly
[delegates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2485)
the request to a `replica`, but it has one important role - in case
the request runs into "write intents" (i.e. uncommitted values), it
deals with those intents. This handles read-write and write-write
conflicts between transactions. Notice that the code calling the
`replica` is inside [a big infinite retry
loop](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2454)
and that a bunch of the code inside it deals with
[`WriteIntentError`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2494). When
we see such an error, we [try to "resolve"
it](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2522)
using the
[`intentResolver`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/intent_resolver.go#L43). Resolving
means figuring out if the transaction to which the intent belongs is
still pending (it might already be committed or aborted, in which case
the intent is "resolved"), or possibly "pushing" the transaction in
question (forcing it to restart at a higher timestamp, such that it
doesn't conflict with the current txn). If the conflicting txn is no
longer pending or if it was pushed, then the intents can be properly
resolved (i.e. either replaced by a committed value, or simply
discarded). The first part - figuring out the txn status or pushing it
- is done in
[`intentResolver.maybePushTransaction`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/intent_resolver.go#L220):
we can see that a series of `PushTxnRequest`s are batched and sent to
the cluster (meaning the hierarchy of `Sender`s on the current node
will be used, top to bottom, to route the requests to the various
transaction records - see the ["Transaction execution flow"
section](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md)
of the design doc). In case the transaction we're trying to push is
still pending, the decision about whether or not the push is
successful is done [deep in the processing of the
`PushTxnRequest`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L1380)
(several levels below the `Store` level we're discussing here, in the
stack for the spinned-off `PushTxnRequest`) based on the relative
priorities of the pusher/pushee txns.

The second part - replacing the intents that can now be resolved, is
done through a call to
[`intentResolver.resolveIntents`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/intent_resolver.go#L97).
Back where we left off in
[`Store.Send()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2522),
the call to the `intentResolver`, if successful, will change the
`resolved` field of the `WriteIntentError` which will cause us to
[retry
immediately](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/801a90b25b217e4ed5a833b15151c252bde0d1b0/pkg/storage/store.go#L2533). Otherwise,
we'll retry according to an exponential backoff, waiting for the still
pending transaction that we couldn't push to complete - we don't want
to retry too soon, as we'd almost surely run into the same intent
again (we're working to replace this "polling"-based mechanism for
waiting for a conflicting txn to finish with something more reactive).

### Replica - executing reads, proposing Raft commands

A
[`Replica`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L246)
represents one copy of range, which in turn is a contiguous keyspace
managed by one instance of the Raft consensus algorithm. The system
tries to keep ranges around 64MB, by default.  The `Replica` is the
final `Sender` in our hierarchy. The role of all the other `Sender`s
was, mostly, to route requests to the `Replica` currently acting as
the lease holder for the range (a _primus inter pares_ `Replica` that
takes on a bunch of coordination responsibilities we'll explore
below).  A replica deals with read requests differently than write
requests. Reads are evaluated directly, whereas writes will enter
another big chapter in their life and go through the Raft consensus
protocol.

The difference between the paths of read requests vs write requests is
seen immediately: `replica.Send()` quickly [branches
off](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1322)
based on the request type. We'll talk about the read/write paths in
turn.

### Read request path

The first thing that is done for a read request is checking if the
request got to the right place (i.e. the current replica is the lease
holder); remember that a lot of the routing was done based on caches
or out-right guesses. This check is performed by
[`replica.redirectOnOrAcquireLease()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1783),
a rabbit hole in its own right. Let's just say that, in case the
current replica is not the lease holder, `redirectOnOrAcquireLease`
either
[redirects](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L992)
to the lease holder, if there is a valid lease (remember that the
`DistSender` will handle such redirections), or [requests a new
lease](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L981)
otherwise, in the hope that it will become the lease
holder. Requesting a lease is done through the
[`pendingLeaseRequest`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_range_lease.go#L33)
helper struct, which coalesces multiple requests for the same lease
and eventually constructs a
[`RequestLeaseRequest`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_range_lease.go#L140)
and [sends it for
execution](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_range_lease.go#L205)
directly to the replica (as we've seen in other cases, bypassing all
the senders to avoid recursing infinitely). In case a lease is
requested, `redirectOnOrAcquireLease` will
[wait](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1012)
for that request to complete and check if it was successful.

Once the lease situation has been settled, the next thing to do for
the read is synchronizing it with possible in-flight writes - if a
write to an overlapping key span is in progress, the read might need
to see its value, so we can't race with it; we must wait until the
write is done. This synchronization is done through the
[`CommandQueue`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/command_queue.go#L32)
struct - an interval tree maintaining all the in-flight requests,
indexed by the key or span of keys that they touch. Waiting for the
writes is done inside
[`replica.beginCmds()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1525). Notice
that immediately after figuring out which commands we need to wait
for, we atomically [add the current
read](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1527)
to the command queue in order to block future writes. This overlaps in
spirit with the use of the `TimestampCache` structure described below
and in fact there is a
[proposal](https://forum.cockroachlabs.com/t/why-do-we-keep-read-commands-in-the-command-queue/360)
for not putting reads in the queue. Removal of commands from the queue
is [done
later](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1811)
through the callback returned by `beginCmds`. This epilogue also does
something else that's important: it [records the
read](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1429)
in the
[`TimestampCache`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/timestamp_cache.go#L85),
a bounded in-memory cache from key range to the latest timestamp at
which it was read. This structure serves to protect against violations
of the Snapshot Isolation transaction isolation level (the lowest that
CockroachDB provides) which require that the outcome of reads must be
preserved, i.e. a write of a key at a lower timestamp than a previous
read must not succeed (see the Read-Write Conflicts – Read Timestamp
Cache section in [Matt's blog
post](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/serializable-lockless-distributed-isolation-cockroachdb/)). As
we'll see in the writes section, writes consult this structure to make
sure they're not writing "under" a read that has already been
performed.

 Now we're reading to actually evaluate the read - control moves to
 [`replica.evaluateBatch()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/75c26e5498ef26a4adde9425cb43682d38ec8ee4/pkg/storage/replica.go#L5225)
 which calls
 [`replica.evaluateCommand`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/75c26e5498ef26a4adde9425cb43682d38ec8ee4/pkg/storage/replica.go#L5286)
 for each request in the batch. `evaluateCommand` switches over the request
 types using a [helper request to method
 map](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L84)
 and [passes
 execution](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L160)
 to the request-specific method. One typical read request is a
 [`ScanRequest`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/roachpb/api.proto#L204);
 this is evaluated by
 [`evalScan`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L343). The
 code is very brief - it immediately
 [calls](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L374)
 a corresponding on the `engine` - a handle to the on-disk
 [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) database. Before we dig a bit into
 this `engine`, let's look at what `evalScan` will do next: it will
 [return
 intents](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L360)
 to the higher levels. These are intents that the scanning
 encountered, but they didn't prohibit it from continuing
 (e.g. intents with a timestamp higher than the timestamp at which
 we're reading - the read doesn't care if those intents are committed
 or not); this is in contrast with intents that do block the read -
 those, as we'll see below, are transformed into `WriteIntentError`s
 which we've seen that they're handled by the [`Store`](#Store). These
 non-interfering intents are collected for cleanup purposes - they
 might be garbage left-over by dead transactions and we want to
 proactively clean them up. They're returned up the stack until
 `replica.addReadOnlyCmd` [tries to clean them
 up](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1837)
 using our old friend, the `intentResolver`.

### Engine

We're getting to the bottom of the CockroachDB stack - the
[`Engine`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/engine.go#L159)
is an interface abstracting away different on-disk stores. The only
implementation we currently use is
[`RocksDB`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/rocksdb.go#L265),
which is a wrapper around the RocksDB C++ library. We won't go into
this wrapper other than to say that it uses
[cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) for interfacing with C++ code. We
also won't go into the RocksDB code which, although it's obviously an
important part of servicing a request, is not something that
CockroachDB devs generally deal with.

For reads, the entry point into the `engine` package is
[`mvccScanInternal()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/mvcc.go#L1480). This
performs a scan over the KV database, dealing with the data
representation we use for [MultiVersion Concurrency
Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)
(MVCC). It iterates over the key/vals of the requested range and
[appends](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/mvcc.go#L1511)
each one to the results. The MVCC details, such as the fact that we
keep multiple versions of each key (for different timestamps) and the
intents, are handled by
[`MVCCIterate()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/mvcc.go#L1555),
which uses an iterator provided by the `Engine` to scan over
key/vals. It delegates reading key/vals and advancing the iterator to
[`mvccGetInternal()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/engine/mvcc.go#L659).

### Write request path

Write requests are conceptually more interesting than reads because
they're not simply serviced by one node/replica. Instead, they go
through the Raft consensus algorithm, which maintains an ordered
commit log, and are then applied by all of a range's replicas (see the
[Raft
section](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/master/docs/design.md#raft---consistency-of-range-replicas)
of the design doc for more details). The replica that initiates this
process is, just like in the read case, the lease holder. Execution on
this lease holder is thus broken into two stages - before ("upstream
of" in code) Raft and below ("downstream of") Raft. The upstream stage
will eventually block for the corresponding Raft command to be applied
*locally* (after the command has been applied locally, future reads
are guaranteed to see its effects).

For what follows we'll introduce some terminology. We've already seen
that a `replica` (and the KV subsystem in general) receives
*requests*. In what follows, these requests will be _evaluated_, which
transforms them to Raft _commands_. The commands in turn are
_proposed_ to the Raft consensus group and, after the Raft group
accepts the proposals and commits them, control comes back to the
`Replica`s (all of the replicas of a range this time, not just the
lease holder), which _apply_ them.

Execution of write commands, mirroring the reads, starts in
[`replica.addWriteCmd()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1857). This
method just contains a retry loop that deals with exceptional cases in
which requests need to be evaluated repeatedly and delegates to
[`replica.tryAddWriteCmd`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1872). This
guy does a number of things:

1. It [waits until overlapping in-flight requests are
   done](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1959)
   and adds the current as an in-flight request to the `CommandQueue`
   (similar to the reads).

2. It checks that the current replica is the lease holder by [calling
   the `redirectOnOrAcquireLease`
   method](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1983),
   just like the reads.

3. It ["applies the timestamp
   cache"](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2002)
   - meaning that the `TimestampCache` we've discussed above is checked
   to see if the write can proceed at the timestamp at which it's trying
   to modify that database. If it can't (because there's been a more
   recent overlapping read), the write's timestamp [is
   bumped](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1688)
   to a timestamp later than any overlapping read).

4. It evaluates the request and proposes resulting Raft commands. It
   all starts with [this call to
   replica.propose()](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2036). We'll
   describe the process below (it will be fun) but, before we do, let's
   see what the current method will do afterwards.

5. The call to `replica.propose` returns a channel that [we'll wait
   on](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2051). This
   is the decoupling point that we've anticipated above - the point where
   we cede control to the Raft machinery. The `replica` doing the
   proposals accepts its role as merely one of many replicas and waits
   for the consensus group to make progress in lock-step. The channel
   will receive a result when the (local) replica has applied the
   respective commands, which can happen only after the commands have
   been committed to the shared Raft log (a global operation).

6. As in the reads case, at the end of the `tryAddWriteCmd` method,
   [an
   epilogue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L1968)
   will remove the request from the `CommandQueue` and add it to the
   timestamp cache.

#### Evaluation of requests and application of Raft commands

As promised, let's see what happens inside `replica.propose()`. The
first thing is the process of evaluation, i.e. turning a KV *request*
into a Raft *command*. This is done through the call to
[`requestToProposal()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2270),
which quickly calls
[`evaluateProposal()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2119),
which in turn quickly calls the surprisingly-named
[`applyRaftCommandInBatch`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2158). This
last method [simulates the execution of the
request](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3737),
if you will, and records all the would-be changes to the `Engine` into
a "batch" (these batches are how RocksDB models transactions). This
batch will be
[serialized](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3778)
into a Raft command. If we were to commit this batch now, the changes
would be live, but just on this one replica, which would be a
potential data consistency violation. Instead, we [abort
it](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3784). It
will resurrect again when the command "comes out of Raft", as we'll
see.

The simulation part takes place inside the
[`executeWriteBatch()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3822)
method. This takes in the `roachpb.BatchRequest` (the KV request we've
been dealing with all along), [allocates an
`engine.Batch`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3835)
and delegates to
[`evaluateBatch()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/75c26e5498ef26a4adde9425cb43682d38ec8ee4/pkg/storage/replica.go#L5225). This
fellow finally
[iterates](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L4041)
over the individual requests in the batch and, for each one, calls
[`evaluateCommand`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/75c26e5498ef26a4adde9425cb43682d38ec8ee4/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L63). We've
seen `evaluateCommand` before, on the read path. It switches over the
different types of requests and [calls a method specific to each
type](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L160). One
such method would be
[`evalPut`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L225),
which writes a value for a key. Inside it we'll see a [call to the
engine](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica_command.go#L249)
to perform this write (but remember, it's all performed inside a
RocksDB transaction, the `engine.Batch`).

This was all for the purposes of recording the engine changes that
need to be proposed to Raft. Let's unwind the stack to
`replica.propose` (the method that started this section), and see what
happens with the result of
[`requestToProposal`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2270). For
one, it gets [inserted
into](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2292)
the "pending proposals map" - a structure that will make the
connection between a command being *applied* and `tryAddWriteCmd`
which will be blocked on a channel waiting for the local
application. More importantly, it gets passed to
[`replica.submitProposalLocked`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2294)
which, eventually, calls
[`raftGroup.Propose()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2396). This
`raftGroup` is a handle to a consensus group, implemented by the [Etcd
Raft library](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/raft), a
black box to which we submit proposals to have them serialized through
majority voting into a coherent distributed log. This library is
responsible for passing the commands in order to all the replicas for
*application*.

This concludes the discussion of the part specific to the lease holder
replica: how commands are proposed to Raft and how the lease holder is
waiting for them to be applied before returning a reply to the (KV)
client. What's missing is the discussion on how exactly they are
applied.

#### Raft command application

We've seen how commands are "put into" Raft. But how do they "come
out"? The Etcd Raft library implements a distributed state machine
whose description is beyond the present scope. Suffice to say that we
have a
[`raftProcessor`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/scheduler.go#L112)
interface that state transitions from this library call to. Our older
friend the `Store` implements this interface and the important method
is
[`Store.processReady()`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/store.go#L3337). This
will eventually call back into a specific `replica` (the replica of a
range that's being modified by each command), namely it will call
[`handleRaftReadyRaftMuLocked`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2484). This
will [iterate through newly committed
commands](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L2616)
calling
[`processRaftCommand`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3247)
for each one. This will in take the serialized `engine.Batch` and call
[`replica.applyRaftCommand`](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3467)
with it. Here the batch is [deserialized and applied to the
engine](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3644)
and, this time, unlike on the proposed side in
`applyRaftCommandInBatch`, the changes are actually [committed to
storage](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3683). The
command has now been applied (on one particular replica, but keep in
mind that the process described in this section happens on *every*
replica).

We've glossed over something in `processRaftCommand` that's important:
after applying the command, if the current replica is proposer
(i.e. the lease holder), we need to signal the proposer (which, as we
saw in the previous section, is blocked in `tryAddWriteCmd`). This
happens at the [very
end](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/33c18ad1bcdb37ed6ed428b7527148977a8c566a/pkg/storage/replica.go#L3513). We've
now come full circle - the proposer will now be unblocked and receive
a response on the channel it was waiting on, and it can unwind the
stack letting its client know that the request is complete. This reply
can travel through the hierarchy of `Sender`s, back from the lease
holder node to the SQL gateway node, to a SQL tree of `planNode`s, to
the SQL Executor, and, through the `pgwire` implementation, to the SQL
client.
