# Cluster-level events

Events in this category pertain to an entire cluster and are
not relative to any particular tenant.

In a multi-tenant setup, the system.eventlog table for individual
tenants cannot contain a copy of cluster-level events; conversely,
the system.eventlog table in the system tenant cannot contain the
SQL-level events for individual tenants.

Events in this category are logged to channel OPS.
