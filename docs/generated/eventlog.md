# Documentation for notable events

Certain notable events are reported using a structured format.
Commonly, these notable events are also copied to the table
`system.eventlog`, unless the cluster setting
`server.eventlog.enabled` is unset.

Additionally, notable events are copied to specific external logging
channels, where they can be collected for further processing.

The sections below document the possible notable event types
in this version of CockroachDB. For each event type, a table
documents the possible fields. A field may be omitted from
an event if its value is empty or zero.

A field is also marked as “Sensitive” if it may contain
application-specific information or PII. In that case,
the copy of the event sent to the external logging channel
may contain redaction markers, in a way compatible
with the redaction facilities in `debug zip` or `debug merge-log`.

## Cluster-level events

Events in this category pertain to an entire cluster and are
not relative to any particular tenant.

In a multi-tenant setup, the system.eventlog table for individual
tenants cannot contain a copy of cluster-level events; conversely,
the system.eventlog table in the system tenant cannot contain the
SQL-level events for individual tenants.

Events in this category are logged to channel OPS.
