This folder contains documentation generated from sources in `pkg/sql/parser`
using `docgen`.

These files are copied to the `docs` repository where they are included in pages
that document SQL. This happens periodically to ensure they stay up-to-date, for
instance during the release process, but it is also strongly encouraged to
open a docs PR with the updated generated files following any PR that changes
them, so that the relevant context is still fresh in everyone's mind in case any
questions come up.
