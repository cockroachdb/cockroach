      how_to_use: This metric gives the node's clock skew. In a well-configured environment, the actual clock skew would be in the sub-millisecond range. A skew exceeding 5 ms is likely due to a NTP service mis-configuration. Reducing the actual clock skew reduces the probability of uncertainty related conflicts and corresponding retires which has a positive impact on workload performance. Conversely, a larger actual clock skew increases the probability of retries due to uncertainty conflicts, with potentially measurable adverse effects on workload performance.

        This only reflects successful heartbeats and measures gRPC overhead as well as
        possible head-of-line blocking. Elevated values in this metric may hint at
        network issues and/or saturation, but they are no proof of them. CPU overload
        can similarly elevate this metric. The operator should look towards OS-level
        metrics such as packet loss, retransmits, etc, to conclusively diagnose network
        issues. Heartbeats are not very frequent (~seconds), so they may not capture
        rare or short-lived degradations.

      how_to_use: This metric gives the average queue length of the storage device. It characterizes the storage device's performance capability. All I/O performance metrics are Linux counters and correspond to the avgqu-sz in the Linux iostat command output. You need to view the device queue graph in the context of the actual read/write IOPS and MBPS metrics that show the actual device utilization. If the device is not keeping up, the queue will grow. Values over 10 are bad. Values around 5 mean the device is working hard trying to keep up. For internal (on chassis) NVMe devices, the queue values are typically 0. For network connected devices, such as AWS EBS volumes, the normal operating range of values is 1 to 2. Spikes in values are OK. They indicate an I/O spike where the device fell behind and then caught up. End users may experience inconsistent response times, but there should be no cluster stability issues. If the queue is greater than 5 for an extended period of time and IOPS or MBPS are low, then the storage is most likely not provisioned per Cockroach Labs guidance. In AWS EBS, it is commonly an EBS type, such as gp2, not suitable as database primary storage. If I/O is low and the queue is low, the most likely scenario is that the CPU is lacking and not driving I/O. One such case is a cluster with nodes with only 2 vcpus which is not supported sizing for production deployments. There are quite a few background processes in the database that take CPU away from the workload, so the workload is just not getting the CPU. Review storage and disk I/O.

        or the local node overflowing its outgoing buffers, for example due to overload.

        Retransmissions also occur in the absence of problems, as modern TCP stacks
        err on the side of aggressively retransmitting segments.

        The linux tool 'ss -i' can show the Linux kernel's smoothed view of round-trip

        Number of followers (i.e. Replicas) to which replication is currently paused to help them recover from I/O overload.

        Such Replicas will be ignored for the purposes of proposal quota, and will not
        receive replication traffic. They are essentially treated as offline for the
        purpose of replication. This serves as a crude form of admission control.

        The count is emitted by the leaseholder of each range.

        Latency of batch KV requests (including errors) executed on this node.

        This measures requests already addressed to a single replica, from the moment
        at which they arrive at the internal gRPC endpoint to the moment at which the
        response (or an error) is returned.

        This latency includes in particular commit waits, conflict resolution and replication,
        and end-users can easily produce high measurements via long-running transactions that
        conflict with foreground traffic. This metric thus does not provide a good signal for
        understanding the health of the KV layer.

        Latency histogram for applying a batch of Raft commands to the state machine.

        This metric is misnamed: it measures the latency for *applying* a batch of
        committed Raft commands to a Replica state machine. This requires only
        non-durable I/O (except for replication configuration changes).

        Note that a "batch" in this context is really a sub-batch of the batch received
        for application during raft ready handling. The
        'raft.process.applycommitted.latency' histogram is likely more suitable in most
        cases, as it measures the total latency across all sub-batches (i.e. the sum of
        commandcommit.latency for a complete batch).

        Latency histogram for handling a Raft ready.

        This measures the end-to-end-latency of the Raft state advancement loop, including:
        - snapshot application
        - SST ingestion
        - durably appending to the Raft log (i.e. includes fsync)
        - entry application (incl. replicated side effects, notably log truncation)

        These include work measured in 'raft.process.commandcommit.latency' and
        'raft.process.applycommitted.latency'. However, matching percentiles of these
        metrics may be *higher* than handleready, since not every handleready cycle
        leads to an update of the others. For example, under tpcc-100 on a single node,
        the handleready count is approximately twice the logcommit count (and logcommit
        count tracks closely with applycommitted count).

        High percentile outliers can be caused by individual large Raft commands or
        storage layer blips. Lower percentile (e.g. 50th) increases are often driven by
        CPU exhaustion or storage layer slowdowns.

        Latency histogram for committing Raft log entries to stable storage

        This measures the latency of durably committing a group of newly received Raft
        entries as well as the HardState entry to disk. This excludes any data
        processing, i.e. we measure purely the commit latency of the resulting Engine
        write. Homogeneous bands of p50-p99 latencies (in the presence of regular Raft
        traffic), make it likely that the storage layer is healthy. Spikes in the
        latency bands can either hint at the presence of large sets of Raft entries
        being received, or at performance issues at the storage layer.

        Number of bytes in messages processed by Raft.

        Messages reflected here have been handed to Raft (via RawNode.Step). This does not imply that the
        messages are no longer held in memory or that IO has been performed. Raft delegates IO activity to
        Raft ready handling, which occurs asynchronously. Since handing messages to Raft serializes with
        Raft ready handling and size the size of an entry is dominated by the contained pebble WriteBatch,
        on average the rate at which this metric increases is a good proxy for the rate at which Raft ready
        handling consumes writes.

        The duration elapsed between having evaluated a BatchRequest and it being

        This encompasses time spent in the quota pool, in replication (including
        reproposals), and application, but notably *not* sequencing latency (i.e.
        contention and latch acquisition).

        No measurement is recorded for read-only commands as well as read-write commands
        which end up not writing (such as a DeleteRange on an empty span). Commands that
        result in 'above-replication' errors (i.e. txn retries, etc) are similarly
        excluded. Errors that arise while waiting for the in-flight replication result
        or result from application of the command are included.

        Note also that usually, clients are signalled at beginning of application, but
        the recorded measurement captures the entirety of log application.

        The duration is always measured on the proposer, even if the Raft leader and
        leaseholder are not colocated, or the request is proposed from a follower.

        Commands that use async consensus will still cause a measurement that reflects
        the actual replication latency, despite returning early to the client.

        Counter of raftpb.Entry.Size() read from pebble for raft log entries.

        These are the bytes returned from the (raft.Storage).Entries method that were not
        returned via the raft entry cache. This metric plus the raft.entrycache.read_bytes
        metric represent the total bytes returned from the Entries method.

        Since pebble might serve these entries from the block cache, only a fraction of this
        throughput might manifest in disk metrics.

        Entries tracked in this metric incur an unmarshalling-related CPU and memory
        overhead that would not be incurred would the entries be served from the raft
        entry cache.

        The bytes returned here do not correspond 1:1 to bytes read from pebble. This
        metric measures the in-memory size of the raftpb.Entry, whereas we read its
        encoded representation from pebble. As there is no compression involved, these
        will generally be comparable.

        A common reason for elevated measurements on this metric is that a store is
        falling behind on raft log application. The raft entry cache generally tracks
        entries that were recently appended, so if log application falls behind the
        cache will already have moved on to newer entries.

        Number of requests that have been stuck for a long time acquiring latches.

        Latches moderate access to the KV keyspace for the purpose of evaluating and
        replicating commands. A slow latch acquisition attempt is often caused by
        another request holding and not releasing its latches in a timely manner. This
        in turn can either be caused by a long delay in evaluation (for example, under
        severe system overload) or by delays at the replication layer.

        This gauge registering a nonzero value usually indicates a serious problem and
        should be investigated.

        expect to see 'requests.slow.raft' to register a nonzero value, indicating

        the gauge is incremented (and decremented again once the request is either

        The number of checkpoint directories found in storage.

        This is the number of directories found in the auxiliary/checkpoints directory.
        Each represents an immutable point-in-time storage engine checkpoint. They are
        cheap (consisting mostly of hard links), but over time they effectively become a
        full copy of the old state, which increases their relative cost. Checkpoints
        must be deleted once acted upon (e.g. copied elsewhere or investigated).

        A likely cause of having a checkpoint is that one of the ranges in this store
        had inconsistent data among its replicas. Such checkpoint directories are
        located in auxiliary/checkpoints/rN_at_M, where N is the range ID, and M is the
        Raft applied index at which this checkpoint was taken.

        Cumulative size of storage engine KVs written to sstables during flushes and compactions due to open LSM snapshots.

        Various subsystems of CockroachDB take LSM snapshots to maintain a consistent view
        of the database over an extended duration. In order to maintain the consistent view,
        flushes and compactions within the storage engine must preserve keys that otherwise
        would have been dropped. This increases write amplification, and introduces keys
        that must be skipped during iteration. This metric records the cumulative number of
        bytes preserved during flushes and compactions over the lifetime of the process.

        Cumulative count of storage engine KVs written to sstables during flushes and compactions due to open LSM snapshots.

        Various subsystems of CockroachDB take LSM snapshots to maintain a consistent view
        of the database over an extended duration. In order to maintain the consistent view,
        flushes and compactions within the storage engine must preserve keys that otherwise
        would have been dropped. This increases write amplification, and introduces keys
        that must be skipped during iteration. This metric records the cumulative count of
        KVs preserved during flushes and compactions over the lifetime of the process.

        Running measure of write-amplification.

        Write amplification is measured as the ratio of bytes written to disk relative to the logical
        bytes present in sstables, over the life of a store. This metric is a running average
        of the write amplification as tracked by Pebble.
