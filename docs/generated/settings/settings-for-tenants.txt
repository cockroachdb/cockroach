This can be overridden on an individual connection with the 'results_buffer_size' parameter. Note that auto-retries generally only happen while no results have been delivered to the client, so reducing this size can increase the number of retriable errors a client receives. On the other hand, increasing the buffer size can increase the delay until the client receives the first result row. Updating the setting only affects new connections.
