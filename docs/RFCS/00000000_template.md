- Feature Name:
- Status: draft/in-progress/completed/rejected/obsolete
- Start Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Authors: 
- RFC PR: (PR # after acceptance of initial draft)
- Cockroach Issue: (one or more # from the issue tracker)

# Summary

One para explanation of the proposed change.

Suggested contents:
- What is being proposed
- Why (short reason)
- How (short plan)
- Impact

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation

How do we teach this?

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the project and
you were teaching it to another CockroachDB programmer. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how CockroachDB contributors and users should think about
  the feature, and how it should impact the way they use
  CockroachDB. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.
- If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to
  existing roachers and new roachers.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for core internals), this
section should focus on how contributors should think about
the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs,
this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the
policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

# Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous
section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those
examples work.

## Detailed design

What / how.

Outline both "how it works" and "what needs to be changed and in which order to get there."

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions


- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC
  process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the
  implementation of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that
  could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that
  comes out of this RFC?
