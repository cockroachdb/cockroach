- Feature Name: DateStyle/IntervalStyle Enabled by Default
- Status: in-progress
- Start Date: 2021-11-12
- Authors: Ebony Brown
- RFC PR: [#75084](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/pull/75084)
- Cockroach Issue: [#69352](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/69352)

# Summary

This document describes the process of enabling the DateStyle/IntervalStyle options by default.
In its current state, date to string and interval to string casts aren't restricted when the DateStyle/IntervalStyle session 
variables are false. This allows for inconsistencies in formatting when the session variables are true.

Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE t (
    it interval,
    computed string AS ((it + interval '2 minutes')::string) STORED
);

INSERT INTO t VALUES ('12:34:56.123456');
SELECT  * FROM t;
        it          |       computed
--------------------+---------------------
PT12H34M56.123456S  | PT12H36M56.123456S

SET intervalstyle_enabled = true;
SET intervalstyle = 'sql_standard';

INSERT INTO t VALUES ('12:34:56.1234');
SELECT  * FROM t;

it               |       computed
-----------------+---------------------
12:34:56.123456  | PT12H36M56.123456S
12:34:56.1234    | 12:36:56.1234



```

This will be 
corrected by removing the session variables as well as rewriting all instances of the violating cast in computed columns.

# Background



In 21.2 an experimental feature was added to CockroachDB which allowed Datestyle and Intervalstyle to take on multiple values.
The change was experimental due to it affecting the volatility of cast to and from the Date, Time, and Interval types.
The casts were changed from Immutable to Stable, meaning their results can change across SQL statements and should not 
be supported in computed columns.

Currently, users can cast date and interval types to strings within a computed column, enable the Datestyle feature and change formats.
This leads to formatting inconsistencies since there is no way to reformat these strings.

# Design

## Migration

We’d start a long-running migration that queries for all descriptors in system descriptors. We will iterate through the
descriptors looking at each column. For every computed column found, we will check the computed expression volatility. If we find 
an expression that isn't immutable, we can assume it's the violating cast and rewrite the expression. We will walk through 
the expression, and using a visitor type assert the cast expressions into function expressions. Doing this will allow us to 
use the builtin "parse_interval" and "to_char_with_style", created during the original Date/IntervalStyle implementation.
Other date to string cast seem to be blocked, so we can focus on the two instances that are not. After rewriting the casts
they are batched together and saved.


# Alternative Considered

We also considered a simpler approach which involved keeping the session variables for one more release. If version 22.1 
is active, datestyle/intervalstyle enabled variables will be ignored since they will be enabled by default. If not we’d
add a migration to the registry which checks the virtual table and if it is populated blocks the upgrade. We’d issue an 
error that specifies that the violating cast are no longer supported. The customers could use the virtual table to determine 
what needs to be changed in order for the migration to be finalized.  
For CC, the SRE team would have to be notified as 
soon as possible about this change. They’d then have to facilitate reaching out to the customers about altering their 
data if they want to finalize the upgrade. We can then allow customers to keep their date-string cast, if they enable
intervalstyle/datestyle we can warn them about the cast issue and leave the decision to them.

We also considered using a virtual table with a precondition when rewriting the violating cast. The virtual table would contain 
all computed columns where there are instances of date/interval type to string type casts. It would be populated by iterating
through the table descriptors of all public columns and creating a row for every computed column containing a cast with
stable volatility. This would require a full KV scan which would be expensive. We found this step wouldn't be necessary
since we could iterate through the descriptors during the long-running migration.
