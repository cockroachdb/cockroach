# Summary

This RFC proposes to introduce an additional level in the namespace
structure of stored objects (tables, views, sequences), called the
*schema namespace*, in between the database and objects themselves,
and enable SQL client to create their own schemas side-by-side inside
a database.

This makes it possible to have two tables with the same name, say
`orders`, in the same database, by making them live in separate
schemas: for example, `mydb.testschema.orders` and
`mydb.prodschema.orders`. This is useful for compatibility and to ease
hosting of multiple users/apps on a single cluster.

# Motivation

There are two motivations:

A. compatibility with PostgreSQL -- ORMs and client apps expect this to
   work.
B. simplify the management of multi-user or multi-app clusters.

The scenario for the point B goes as follows:

1. suppose hosting company HostedInc, with customer TheUser.
2. TheUser staff wants to deploy multiple apps over time but does not
   want to inform HostedInc continuously about this.
3. Meanwhile HostedInc doesn't want to provide root access to TheUser,
   because that would cause risks to the stability of the hosted cluster.
4. The question thus arises: how to enable TheUser to deploy multiple
   apps without providing root access? *Currently root access is
   required to create new databases.*

The proposed solution, which incidentally is both industry-standard
and already expected by users, goes as follows:

1. HostedInc creates a single database for TheUser.
2. HostedInc grants the "create schema" privilege to TheUser.
3. TheUser creates 1 schema per app in their database, and grants
   finer-tuned permissions on each schema for each app.
4. The app developers (or the apps themselves) create the tables/objects
   they need in their respective schemas.

# Guide-level explanation

Currently CockroachDB supports a hierarchical system of two levels to
organize stored objects (tables/views/sequences):

```
database
  |
  +---- object
```

For example:

```
bank
  |
  +---- users
  |
  +---- accounts
```

To *access* an object, CockroachDB currently allows queries to specify
a name with 1, 2 or 3 components:

```
   > select * from users;
   > select * from bank.users;
   > select * from bank.public.users;
```

The 1-part form assumes that `bank` has been configured as "current
database" with `SET database = bank` or `USE bank`.

In the 3-part form, the middle part (`public` in this example) is
currently ignored [1].

This RFC proposes to change the hierarchical model for organizing
stored objects as follows:

```
database
  |
  +---- schema
          |
          +---- object
```

For example:

```
bank
  |
  +---- production
  |        |
  |        +---- users
  |        |
  |        +---- accounts
  |
  +---- testing
           |
           +---- users
           |
           +---- accounts
```

With this structure, an app can access a table as follows:

- using a simple 1-part name, e.g. `users`, both the "current database"
  (`SET database` / `USER`) and the *current schema* (`SET
  search_path`) decide which object is designated.
- using a 3-part name, e.g. `bank.production.users` all the components
  are clearly specified.
- using a 2-part name, we have to deal with two different cases:

  - PostgreSQL-compatible applications will use e.g. `production.users`, where
    the first part specifies the schema and the second part the object.
  - CockroachDB-specific applications developed pre-2.2 will use e.g.
    `bank.users`.
	
  This ambiguity is *already* supported in CockroachDB since version
  2.0 as follows:
  
  - if the name has 2 components and the 1st component refers to a valid
    schema name, then it is understood to refer to that schema.
  - otherwise if the 1st component refers to a valid database name,
    then use that database and the schema name `public`.
  - otherwise an error is reported.

[1] the explanation above fully avoids discussing virtual schemas like
`pg_catalog` and `information_schema`. These are not relevant to
this section.

# Reference-level explanation

See the previous section.

In addition, here one should understand that CockroachDB internally
already has a very good understanding of PostgreSQL schemas, because
that understanding is needed to properly support `pg_catalog` and
`information_schema` (these are schemas).

So really, CockroachDB already has adequate schema support in that the
name resolution rules in the SQL dialect are already suitable.

The missing block is the ability to create 1) additional 2) stored 3)
user-defined schemas.

1. additional: currently just one stored schema is supported. It is anonymous
   in storage (`system.namespace` knows nothing about it) and called
   `public` in SQL. We want other schemas beside `public`.
2. stored: the schemas must continue to exist across cluster restarts,
   so they cannot be in-memory data structures only.
3. user-defined: client apps must be able to manage their own schemas
   with CREATE/ALTER/DROP SCHEMA, subject to  syntax and
   permission checks compatible with PostgreSQL.

## Detailed design

Technically the changes impact:

- the format of table descriptors: the parent of a table is now a schema not a database.

- the `system.namespace` table: this must support name resolution for schemas.

- cluster initialization/migration: a stored schema named `public`
  must be created upon cluster initialization.

- the SQL/KV name resolution code (`sqlbase/resolver.go`): this must resolve other
  schema names besides "public" and virtual schema names.

- the introspection facilities in `pg_catalog`, `information_schema` and `crdb_internal`: this
  must iterate over all stored schemas.

- Logic for GRANT/REVOKE: this must support privileges on schemas in addition to databases/tables.

- permission checking for CREATE (and perhaps SHOW): this must test the create privilege on
  the target schema not table.

- `cockroach dump`: this must be extended to support dumping a single
  schema inside a database. It must also be extended to properly
  qualify schema names inside the dump data.

- BACKUP/RESTORE: this must be extended to support backing up / restoring a single schema, and
  naming schemas when listing target objects.

- IMPORT CSV: this must be extended to recognize a schema name in the import target.

- IMPORT PGDUMP: this must be extended to disable the "flattening" of
  the schema information contained in the dump to "public", and
  instead preserve/use the schema information in the dump.

- EXPORT: probably no change needed, but QA must verify that users can
  use EXPORT for single schemas, or tables across different schemas.

- the web UI which presents the database objects in a cluster and the
  admin RPC endpoints that support these features in the web UI. This
  must reveal schemas between databases and tables.

  Here maybe no technical changes are required (the web UI already
  knows about schemas, insofar it already knows about virtual
  schemas), but QA must verify user-defined schemas are surfaced
  properly.

Optionally:

- add zone configuration propagation/inheritance from database to
  schema, then from schema to table. This is optional insofar that
  schemas don't have data of their own, so it could be possible to
  inherit directly from database to table even with schemas defined.

  The ability to customize zones per schema would be a feature that
  eases the life of operators/developers.

### Data structures

Relevant quote:

"Show me your flowcharts [code] and conceal your tables [data
structures], and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables
[data structures], and I won’t usually need your flowcharts [code];
they’ll be obvious." -- Fred Brooks, Turing Awards recipient and
author of the Mythical Man-Month.

Central to the new feature in this RFC is the question of how the name
resolution works.

### Current mechanism

Currently in CockroachDB we have the following connected components:

- database descriptors, that know nothing about tables;

- table descriptors, that have their own object ID, and a ParentID
  field that refers to the database descriptor.

- the table `system.namespace` maps:

  - IDs to names (for both databases and tables), with an index on names.
    This supports the name resolution name -> ID.
	
    `select id from system.namespace where name = <requested>`

  - IDs to ParentIDs. This supports listing "all tables of a
    given database".
	
	`select id from system.namespace where parentID = <requested>`

  In `system.namspace`, the listed ParentID for a database descriptor
  is 0. This value is used to distinguish databases from tables and
  can be used to list all databases:
  
    `select id, name from system.namespace where parentID = 0`

In this environment, renaming a table (even across databases) only
requires rewriting entries in `system.namespace`.

This RFC proposes to extend this system in one of the ways suggested
in the following sub-sections, subject to discussion and
experimentation.

### Alternative A: lightweight schemas

In this solution, 1) schemas do not have their own *descriptors*. 2)
low-level schema IDs are global across all databases.

(I like the idea to avoid descriptors because that would ask complex
questions about leases and the allocation of ranges.)

- the field `ParentID` in `TableDescriptor` would be renamed to `ParentDatabaseID`
- a new field `TableDescriptor.ParentSchemaID` would be created.
- database descriptors would remain unchanged.
- `system.namespace` does not change.
- CREATE DATABASE and the migration for pre-2.2 clusters would create
  a `public` schema in every database and populate the new field
  `ParentSchemaID` in every table descriptor.

- CREATE SCHEMA would simply add a row to the `system.namespace` table.

- DROP DATABASE, DROP SCHEMA would iterate over `system.namespace` accordingly.

Example:

```
bank
  |
  +---- production
  |        |
  |        +---- users
  |        |
  |        +---- accounts
  |
  +---- testing
           |
           +---- users
           |
           +---- accounts
```

In this solution `system.namespace` contains:

| parentID | name       | Id |
|----------|------------|----|
| 0        | bank       | 1  |
| 1        | public     | 2  |
| 1        | production | 3  |
| 1        | testing    | 4  |
| 3        | users      | 5  |
| 3        | accounts   | 6  |
| 4        | users      | 7  |
| 4        | accounts   | 8  |

The queries to access tables become:
  
- to resolve the parent schema and database of a table:

  ```
	 select n1.parentID as databaseID, n1.id as schemaID
	   from system.namespace n1, system.namespace n2
    where n1.id = n2.parentID
	    and n2.id = <requested>
  ```

- to list all schemas inside a database:

  `select id from system.namespace where parentID = <requested>`

- to list all tables inside a *schema*:

  `select id from system.namespace where parentID = <requested>`
	
- to list all tables inside a *database*:

  ```
	select n1.id
	  from system.namespace n1, system.namespace n2
   where n1.parentID = n2.id
	   and n2.parentID = <requested>
  ```

In this solution, any additional metadata associated with a schema
(for example, privileges and grants for creating new tables) would be
stored in a separate system table. (to be defined by further experimentation)

Note that it is not necessary to verify schema-level privileges for
non-DDL SQL queries, so the creation of a new separate table to hold
these privileges would not add additional costs to the "hot path" of
latency.

### Alternative B: schemas with descriptors

Similar as above, but we create descriptors for schemas and put the privileges inside.

Question then remains what to do about leasing, range IDs, etc.

### Alternative C: schemas inside database descriptors

This is also similar to A but here low-level schema IDs are local
within 1 database.

- the table descriptor is also changed to have `ParentDatabaseID` and `ParentSchemaID`.
- the database descriptor would be extended to contain a list of schemas descriptors.
  Each of these descriptors would be identified *within* the database descriptor with
  an ID starting at 0.
- every new database descriptor is instantiated with 1 schema descriptor within with ID 0. This will become
  the `public` schema thanks to the next point.
- 2 new columns `schemaID` and `schemaName` are added to `system.namespace`, prefilled with default 0 and "public". These are used both:

  - for databases, to list all schemas in the db.
  - for tables, to tell which schema of its parent DB a table is contained in.

- CREATE DATABASE and the migration for pre-2.2 clusters would add the 2 new columns to `system.namespace` with
  defaults 0 and `public`. This would ensure the `public` schema automatically exists in every DB, and that
  every existing table gets connected to it automatically.

- CREATE SCHEMA would add a new schema descriptor inside the parent db descriptor, then add a row to the `system.namespace` table.

- DROP DATABASE, DROP SCHEMA would iterate over `system.namespace` accordingly.

Example:

```
bank
  |
  +---- production
  |        |
  |        +---- users
  |        |
  |        +---- accounts
  |
  +---- testing
           |
           +---- users
           |
           +---- accounts
```

In this solution `system.namespace` contains:

| parentID | name     | Id | SchemaID | SchemaName |
|----------|----------|----|----------|------------|
| 0        | bank     | 1  | 0        | public     |
| 0        | bank     | 1  | 1        | production |
| 0        | bank     | 1  | 2        | testing    |
| 1        | users    | 2  | 1        |            |
| 1        | accounts | 3  | 1        |            |
| 1        | users    | 4  | 2        |            |
| 1        | accounts | 5  | 2        |            |

- the queries to resolve names become:

  - to resolve the parent schema and database of a table: look up the parent db descriptor
    from `ParentDatabaseID`, then look up the schema inside the db descriptor from `ParentSchemaID`.
	
	This is faster than for alternative A above.

  - to list all schemas inside a database:

    - schema details: simply iterate over the schema descriptors inside the db descriptor
	
	- schema names:
	
      `select schemaID, schemaName from system.namespace where id = <requested>`

  - to list all tables inside a *schema*:

    `select id from system.namespace where parentID = <dbId> and schemaID = <schemaId>`
	
  - to list all tables inside a *database*:
  
    ```
	select id from system.namespace where parentID = <requested>
    ```


In this solution, any additional metadata associated with a schema
(for example, privileges and grants for creating new tables) would be
stored in the parent db descriptor.
