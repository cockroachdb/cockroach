# About this directory

This directory contains RFCs (design documents) that describe
proposed changes to cockroach.

# RFC process

Before making major changes, consider sending an RFC for discussion.
This is a lightweight design-document process that is inspired by the
[process used by the rust project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs).

1. Copy `template.md` or `template.rst` to a new file and fill in the details.
   Commit this version in your own fork of the repository or a branch.
2. Submit a pull request to add your new file to the main repository.
   Each RFC should get its
   own pull request; do not combine RFCs with other files.
3. Go through the PR review. If there is consensus to proceed with the
   project, change the `Status` field of the document to
   `in-progress`, update the `RFC PR` field, and merge the PR. If the
   project is rejected, either abandon the PR or merge it with a
   status of `rejected` (depending on whether the document and
   discussion are worth preserving for posterity).
4. Once the changes described in the RFC have been made, change the
   status of the PR from `in-progress` to `completed`. If subsequent
   developments render an RFC obsolete, set its status to `obsolete`.

When you mark a RFC as obsolete, ensure that its text references the
other RFCs or PRs that make it obsolete.

# RFC Status

During its lifetime a RFCs can have the following status:

Draft
   A newly minted RFC has this status, until either
   the proposal is accepted (next status:
   in-progress) or that it is DOA (next status: rejected).

In-progress
   A RFC receives this status when the PR discussions have concluded
   the proposal should be implemented, and the RFC is ready to commit
   (merge) in the main repository.  Next status: completed (when the
   work is done), rejected (proposal not implemented/implementable
   after all), obsolete (some subsequent work removes the need for the
   feature).

Completed
   A RFC receives this status when the described feature has been
   implemented. Next status: obsolete.

Obsolete
   A RFC receives this status when the described feature
   has been superseded.
