# Summary

This RFC proposes introducing Console-issued accept tokens as a CRDB login 
method. This change would enable single sign-on (SSO) for CRDB, allowing users
to login automatically and have a more consolidated login experience for CRDB and 
CC Console. 

This RFC seeks to achieve the following goals:
* Users are able to create sessions without using "something you know" authentication.
* Human users are able to use CC-issued, short-lived credentials to access CRDB.
* Human users, having only entered login credentials into their identity provider, are able to 
create an active CRDB session with a CRDB Cloud cluster.
* Service accounts hosted in the customerâ€™s identity provider are able to create an active CRDB 
  session while only entering their credentials into their identity provider.
* Service accounts hosted in CC Console must be able to create an active CRDB session.

The following are out of scope:
* Authorization e.g. user permissions propagation from CC to CRDB
* Just-in-time provisioning of SQL users at login time

# Motivation

Customers are currently unable to enforce their enterprise authentication policies and 
are unable to ensure a single point of access across the product for their users.

As support for CC SSO grows, it is crucial that we provide SSO for CRDB as well 
to prevent any confusion for organization admins regarding seeing
different authentication methods across the product. 

# Background

Currently, clients can authenticate themselves to the server in the following ways:
* Password 
* SCRAM 
  * A password hashing protocol that offers multiple security benefits 
  over password.
  * Recommended over password, assuming clients can support it (many do not).
* Certificate
  * A certificate/key pair that is signed by a certificate authority is used to 
  authenticate the client.
  * Not supported for CRDB Cloud.
* SQL Session Revival Token
  * Token-based authentication used by SQL Proxy in order to re-authenticate a
    previously-established session.
* Trust (and Reject)
  * Always allows access or never allow access.
  * Usually paired with restrictions such as requiring requests come 
  from specific IP addresses or unix sockets.
* Kerberos / GSSAPI
    * Not supported for CockroachDB Cloud.

This RFC proposes to add a new token-based authentication method that will enable signed access 
tokens to be passed into the password field, 
and this new method will achieve the aforementioned goals.

# Technical Design

The intention is to adhere closely to the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols, where 
CRDB is the resource server, CRDB CLI plays the role of the OIDC client (for humans users whereas
non-interactive users themselves will be the OIDC client), and 
CC Console plays the role of the OIDC server. 

The token credentials will consist of an access token, an ID token, and a refresh token. These 
tokens have finite lifetimes, and if a user needs long-lived access, refresh tokens 
can be used to request a new set of token credentials. The access token and the ID token both 
have a lifetime value of 60 minutes. However, we expect to eventually make the TTL configurable 
(bounded by minimum and maximum allowed values). Access tokens cannot be revoked and are valid until 
their expiry. In addition to allowing users to refresh their access once they run over the TTL of the 
access token, refresh tokens make it so that users will not have to continually re-authorize. Other 
details about the tokens are included in the table below.

| Token              | Description                                                                                                                                     | Users                           | Type   | Usage | TTL          | Lifetime   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|-------|--------------|------------|
| Access             | Used to gain CRDB access.                                                                                                                       | All                             | signed | many  | short-lived  | 60 minutes |
| Refresh            | Used to obtain a new set of tokens when the current access token has expired (human users).                                                     | Humans                          | opaque | once  | long-lived   | 90 days    |
| Service            | Used to retrieve an access token.                                                                                                               | Service Accounts (rooted in CC) | signed | many  | long-lived   | 30 days    |
| ID                 | Contains information about the user. Needed to follow the OIDC protocol, which we wish to adhere to for easier integration with DB Console SSO. | Humans                          | signed | many  | short-lived  | 60 minutes |
| Authorization Code | Used to retrieve a set of token credentials.                                                                                                    | Humans                          | opaque | once  | short-lived  | 10 minutes |


Access tokens will be JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), and so the tokens contain three segments: header, 
payload, and signature. Below are the claims in the access token:


| Claim      | JWT Part | Format | Description                                                                   |
|------------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `typ`      | Header   | string | The type of token. Always "JWT".                                              |
| `alg`      | Header   | string | The algorithm that was used to sign the token. By default, "RS256".           |
| `kid`      | Header   | string | The thumbprint for the public key that can be used to validate the signature. |
| `aud`      | Payload  | string | The intended recipient of the token - the audience.                           |
| `iss`      | Payload  | string | The issuer of the token.                                                      |
| `iat`      | Payload  | int    | The time when this token was issued.                                          |
| `exp`      | Payload  | int    | The expiration time on or after which the token must not be accepted.         |
| `ccid`     | Payload  | string | The user's CockroachDB Cloud user ID.                                         |
| `username` | Payload  | string | The user's SQL username.                                                      |


ID tokens are also JWTs and are the key extension that OIDC adds to OAuth 2.0. Following the 
OIDC protocol will allow us to more easily integrate with DB Console's existing OIDC 
functionality, and the use of the token will only really be relevant for the integration. An ID 
token can be sent alongside or in lieu of an access token. ID tokens share nearly all the same 
claims that access tokens have but may contain additional claims that carry information about the 
user, and so the information in ID tokens allows for verification that a user is who they state to 
be. ID tokens for a given user will always have the same `ccid` claim (which specifies the user's 
CockroachDB Cloud user ID), so the `ccid` claim will be used to reliably identity users.

The human user login flow will follow the 
[OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/); it will 
look like the following:
1. The CLI redirects the user to a browser to complete the login request.
2. The user will be asked by CC Console if they wish to allow Cockroach CLI to access 
   requested data (note: with the refresh flow the user will not have to continually 
   re-authorize the CLI).
3. The user accepts and is redirected to localhost (which the CLI is listening on) back along 
   with an authorization code.
4. The CLI sends the authorization code to CC Console in a request for token credentials.
5. CC Console generates a set of token credentials specific to the user (and to the
   cluster involved).
6. CC Console responds with the credentials and they are passed like a password in the pgurl.
7. CRDB recognizes that the credential is token-based and validates the 
user, depending on whether the login request succeeds.

CC Console will derive a unique SQL username from the user's email address and will be included 
in the access token and the ID token. The username is generated earlier on at CC user 
creation time and is included on the CC user object. When token credentials are minted, the 
username is included in the credentials. These usernames will start with a prefix `sso_` in 
order to distinguish them from other SQL usernames. Eventually, we will want to support the ability 
to change these usernames if the customer wishes, but it is not a priority considering that the 
customer has presumably created these users already. 

When an access token is presented to CRDB, token validation will include a check to make sure that 
the audience field matches what is expected. The audience field will include 
the client ID in addition to the cluster ID, so that the intended audience is one particular 
cluster. This will prevent a single access token from being used on multiple clusters.

**Add CC API endpoints to mint token credentials (for human users)**

A new CC API, `GenerateAuthorizationCode`, will be added to allow CC Console to give 
authorization for token requests. While the user is redirected to a browser to complete the 
login attempt, CRDB CLI listens on `localhost` for an authorization code, a token that is required 
in order to get token credentials. Assuming the check succeeds, it generates the authorization code and redirects the user
back to the redirect URI.

Regarding client credentials, we plan to add a default client ID and client secret in the binary so 
that CLI can use them for requests to CC Console. **Note that this approach requires that we do 
not grant these 
credentials high-level permissions going forward.**

For the new endpoint, `/oauth2/authorize`, a small webpage will be set up to operate it. 
If the user is not already logged in, the user will be prompted to 
log in and the endpoint will use standard CC Console session cookies for authorization.

Request parameters:
* `client_id` the client's ID.
* `redirect_uri` an authorized redirect URI for the given `client_id`.
* `state` an opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and
    callback.

Response elements:
* `authorization_code` the token to be exchanged for an access code.
* `expires_in` the number of seconds until the authorization code expires.
* `state` an opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and
  callback. CC Console includes this value when redirecting the user back to the CLI.

After receiving the authorization code, the CLI will call to another CC API, 
`GenerateTokens`, which generates token credentials in exchange for the 
authorization code, client credentials, and cluster ID.
The validity of request arguments is checked, and it is checked 
whether the authorization code was created for the given client ID. CC Console uses the 
specified cluster ID in order to set a proper audience field in the access token and ID token.
Assuming the checks succeed, 
the API will return a set of token credentials. Communication with the `/oauth2/token` endpoint 
utilizes TLS.

Request parameters:
* `authorization_code` the token to be exchanged for an access code.
* `client_id` the client's ID.
* `client_secret` the client secret.
* `cluster_id` the cluster ID.

Response elements:
* `access_token` the JWT that allows the user to gain access to CRDB.
* `id_token` the JWT that can be used to authenticate a user.
* `refresh_token` the token that can be used to retrieve new token credentials.
* `expires_in` the remaining lifetime of the access token in seconds.

**Add a CC API endpoint to refresh login tokens (for human users)**

`RefreshTokens` will be added to allow human users to retrieve a new
set of token credentials after expiration. We can have an endpoint `/oauth2/refresh` which the 
user can use to submit a request. It is important to note that the refresh tokens are single-use. 
They will have an `accepted_at` date to indicate if they were used and when. The response of the 
API 
will be identical to `GenerateTokens`.

Request parameters:
* `client_id` the client's identification.
* `client_secret` the client secret.
* `refresh_token` the user sets this to the refresh token they previously
  received.
* `expires_in` the number of seconds until the access token expires.

A successful response of this API is identical to that of `GenerateTokens`.

**Update SQL authentication code to identify and validate access tokens** 

The token gets to the DB by being passed like a password in the pgurl, which also ensures support 
for different drivers since the token will be treated like a plaintext password. The server 
will look at the form of authentication, see that it is a token, and proceed 
to verify the token. If the token is valid, SQL authentication proceeds as if a correct password were provided.

Token validation will look like the following:
1) Check that the `alg` (algorithm) claim matches the expected algorithm which was used to sign
   the token.
2) Check that the signature in the token is the correct signature for the payload - verified using
   the public key provided by CC Console.
3) Check that the issuer from the `iss` claim matches the expected issuer (CC Console).
4) Check that the `aud` (audience) claim contains the expected `client_id` and `cluster_id` values.
5) Check that the `exp` (expiration) claim time has not passed.

CC Console will use the [JSON Web Key (JWK) specification](https://openid.net/specs/draft-jones-json-web-key-03.html). The signing key will rotate
periodically, and in the case of an emergency, could be rotated immediately. The rotation period will be around once a year.
With Intrusion, CC Console will push new public keys to CRDB cloud instances. CC Console will 
sign tokens using [RS256 (RSA Digital Signature
Algorithm with SHA-256)](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/RS256).

An initial validation key set for CRDB will be baked into the image. There will 
always be more than one validation key available during token validation.  By default, there 
will be two keys available, and CC will only issue tokens using the older key set to give 
more leeway for rotations. There will be an option to override default keys with
keys of choice. If CRDB attempts to use expired verification keys to verify the signature 
on a token, CRDB will reject the token. 

Regarding how it will be signaled to CRDB that a JWT is to be passed, we will support a 
method that is similar to what is implemented for serverless regarding specifying tenant names. 
Such methods include (1) a method option such as `accept-jwt=true`, (2) including a prefix to 
the username, or (3) SNI (having an extra subdomain like `jwt`).


## Service Accounts / Non-interactive users

Service accounts (non-interactive users) will trade for SQL access tokens directly. There will be 
slightly different flows depending on if the service account is rooted in (1) the 
customer's identity provider (IdP) or (2) CC Console.

For service accounts hosted in the customer's IdP, the service account user login flow looks like 
the following:
1. The user requests a token from their IdP.
2. The customer's IdP issues a token to the user.
3. The user sends the token to CC Console in the request for an access token.
4. CC Console checks the trust relationship on the app registration and validates the 
   IdP-issued token.
5. Assuming the checks succeed, CC Console issues an access token to the user.
6. The user gains access to CRDB using the CC-issued access token.

**Add a CC API endpoint to generate tokens for service accounts**

A new API `GenerateTokensService` will generate an access token in exchange for client credentials
and the user's service token. Service accounts will directly send requests using this API.
The validity of request arguments is checked. CC Console uses the specified cluster ID in order 
to set a proper audience field in the access token. Assuming the checks succeed,
the API will return an access token. Instead of a refresh token flow, these users 
will rely on a long-lived service token flow.
Endpoint: `/oauth2/service-token`

Request parameters:
* `service_token` the token to be exchanged for an access token.
* `cluster_id` the cluster ID of the cluster that the user is trying to access.

Response elements:
* `access_token` the JWT that allows the user to gain access to CRDB.
* `expires_in` the remaining lifetime of the access token in seconds.


**Create credential management for CC-hosted service accounts**

In order to support CC-hosted service accounts, the console access management UI will be updated 
so that console admins can manage long-lived credentials for CC-hosted service accounts. The 
lifetime for these credentials 
is 30 days. This UI 
will be authorized using standard CC Console session cookies and will enable the user to:
* Manage the service account users
* Issue the proof-of-identity credentials
* Revoke the proof-of-identity credentials

The components of these credentials will include:
* `client_id` the client ID.
* `client_secret` the client secret.
* `cluster_ids` the list of cluster IDs of clusters that the user is permitted to access.

## Self-hosted

The approach outlined here also supports self-hosted customers. Customers can use their own 
infrastructure as the identity provider or CC if they wish. If the customer elects to used 
CC as the credential issuer, their instances would need to trust CC. Customers 
can use their own credential issuer if they wish as well; we can ensure that they can set
the signing key in the same way CC does. We could provide a software microservice they can run in 
their infrastructure that converts their SSO login operations into credentials recognizable to CRDB.

If self-hosted customers elect to use CC for auth, they would need to manually rotate 
keys. However, this setup would probably be rare. 

## Drawbacks

This approach requires that we add more urgency to minimize CC downtime, since any downtime 
would result in login failures.

In the case of a transient network disruption between a driver and CRDB, the CRDB SDK should 
either (1) continually keep an active access token or (2) refresh the access token in the case 
of the event. Unfortunately, most PostgreSQL clients cannot handle the refresh pattern, so users 
would have to add in tools or libraries provided by us in order to use any non-CRL DB clients. 

Once a SQL connection is made, the connection will persist even if the 
credential expires, which can be seen as problematic.

## Alternatives

**Signed Tokens that are not JWTs**

JWTs are commonly used with OAuth 2.0 but our signed tokens do not need to necessarily be JWTs.

Advantages:
* Smaller size - JWTs are large.
* Smaller cost in implementing and using simpler tokens.

**No Refresh Tokens**

If we do not mind having users continually involved in re-auth, we could 
remove refresh tokens entirely. It will likely be more frustrating for the user to continually 
re-authorize the CLI. But it does provide more protection against leaked access tokens.

**Certificate-based authentication**

Instead of token-based authentication, we could implement a certificate centered login flow. 
Certificates are similar in function to signed tokens and so share similar advantages and 
limitations. In this case, certificates are referring to X.509 certs which are most 
commonly used for TLS connections. Certificates are usually valid for an 
extensive period of time, but we could reduce the lifetime if we wished to remove the need for 
revocation. The login flow would happen in the following way:
1) The user performs mTLS handshake when connecting to CRDB.
2) During the handshake, CRDB obtains the cert.
3) CRDB validates the certificate.
4) CRDB extracts information from the cert and ensures that it matches a user.
5) The user is granted access.

Advantages:
* CRDB already supports this form of authn. 

Drawbacks:
* Requires a more intricate technical design.
* Trickier to integrate it with DB Console.
* Still requires a refresh flow.

**Opaque Access Tokens**

We could use SQL accept tokens that are opaque instead of signed. These tokens would
require reaching out to CC (the token issuer) in order to verify tokens.

Drawbacks:
* Higher network latency since every login requires consultation with CC.

Advantages:
* Smaller size - JWTs are quite large.
* Less CPU needed for verification.
* Token revocation becomes easy.
* Reduces risk of data leakages and compliance violations (not possible for a client 
  to access or leak any data from the token). 

**Opaque Tokens (as Time-Limited "Passwords")**

We could use opaque tokens that are effectively auto-generated, short-lived passwords that would be 
sent from CC to CRDB. Such tokens would be verifiable at the cluster level without a network call.

Drawbacks:
* For every access token issued, CC would need to reach into CRDB to issue a token change.
* Assuming no significant changes to the login infrastructure, this change 
would imply that for each database, there would be only a single active 
credential for a user at any given time.

Advantages:
* Less changes needed on the CRDB side.

**Cert/Token hybrid flow for indicating an incoming token**

One alternative method for signaling to CRDB that a JWT is to be passed is to issue a 
certificate that contains the access token. This would also allow clients to easily regenerate 
access tokens. 

Drawbacks: 
* Breaks assumption that the cert is not sensitive since it contains an access token.
* Complexity adding encryption/private key to reduce possibility of the token being extracted by 
  anyone in a privileged network position.

**Device Authorization Flow**

Instead of having the authorization code flow during which the user is authenticated directly 
in CC during the login flow, we could support the device authorization flow so that the CLI can 
simply use the client ID to initiate the authorization process and get tokens. Instead of needing to
log into CC, the user will be asked to go to a link to authorize the CLI. 

**Avoiding Uptime Burden on CC**

If we want to avoid adding high uptime requirements for CC Console, we could consider splitting out 
the login flow from the existing Console code base, and use extra availability strategies to 
make it more redundant and durable than Console currently is. However, removing the CC control 
plane would mean that service accounts hosted in CC could not log in.

We could use a different credential issuer (e.g. use Auth0 to issue credentials). However, 
any 
code we have to facilitate the login process would have to be tightly coupled to the chosen 
vendor. It would mean we would not be able to modify the token encryption method. 
It would also be trickier to allow users to login as other users and to enforce 
username uniqueness constraints.
