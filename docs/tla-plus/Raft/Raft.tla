CONSTANTS Follower, PreCandidate, Candidate, Leader

\* A reserved value.
CONSTANTS Nil

\* Message types:
CONSTANTS RequestVoteRequest, RequestVoteResponse,
          RequestPreVoteRequest, RequestPreVoteResponse,

----
\* Global variables
\* TODO(irfansharif): Allow transition from follower to candidate directly?
\* Semi-randomly i.e.

\* A bag of records representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. TLAPS doesn't support the Bags module, so this is a function
\* mapping Message to Nat.
VARIABLE messages

\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Keeps track of successful elections, including the initial logs of the
\* leader and voters' logs. Set of functions containing various things about
\* successful elections (see BecomeLeader).
VARIABLE elections

\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Keeps track of every log ever in the system (set of logs).
VARIABLE allLogs

----
\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Server).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, PreCandidate, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* The set of requests that can go into the log
VARIABLE clientRequests

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE commitIndex
\* The index that gets committed
VARIABLE committedLog
\* Does the commited Index decrease
VARIABLE committedLogDecrease
logVars == <<log, commitIndex, clientRequests, committedLog, committedLogDecrease >>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesSent
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesGranted
\* A history variable used in the proof. This would not be present in an
\* implementation.
\* Function from each server that voted for this candidate in its currentTerm
\* to that voter's log.
VARIABLE voterLog
candidateVars == <<votesSent, votesGranted, voterLog>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE matchIndex
leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex, elections>>

\* End of per server variables.
----

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).
vars == <<messages, allLogs, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars>>

----
\* Helpers

\* The set of all quorums. This just calculates simple majorities, but the only
\* important property is that every quorum overlaps with every other.
Quorum == {i \in SUBSET(Server) : Cardinality(i) * 2 > Cardinality(Server)}

\* The term of the last entry in a log, or 0 if the log is empty.
LastTerm(xlog) == IF Len(xlog) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE xlog[Len(xlog)].term

\* Helper for Send and Reply. Given a message m and bag of messages, return a
\* new bag of messages with one more m in it.
WithMessage(m, msgs) ==
    IF m \in DOMAIN msgs THEN
        [msgs EXCEPT ![m] = IF msgs[m] < 2 THEN msgs[m] + 1 ELSE 2 ]
    ELSE
        msgs @@ (m :> 1)

\* Helper for Discard and Reply. Given a message m and bag of messages, return
\* a new bag of messages with one less m in it.
WithoutMessage(m, msgs) ==
    IF m \in DOMAIN msgs THEN
        [msgs EXCEPT ![m] = IF msgs[m] > 0 THEN msgs[m] - 1 ELSE 0 ]
    ELSE
        msgs
        
ValidMessage(msgs) ==
    { m \in DOMAIN messages : msgs[m] > 0 }
    
SingleMessage(msgs) ==
    { m \in DOMAIN messages : msgs[m] = 1 } 

\* Add a message to the bag of messages.
Send(m) == messages' = WithMessage(m, messages)

\* Remove a message from the bag of messages. Used when a server is done
\* processing a message.
Discard(m) == messages' = WithoutMessage(m, messages)

\* Combination of Send and Discard
Reply(response, request) ==
    messages' = WithoutMessage(request, WithMessage(response, messages))

\* Return the minimum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x <= y
\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x >= y

                     /\ votesGranted   = [i \in Server |-> {}]
\* The values nextIndex[i][i] and matchIndex[i][i] are never read, since the
\* leader does not send itself messages. It's still easier to include these
\* in the functions.

\* Changelog:
\* 2017-09-07:
\* - Formalise PreVote mechanism.
\*
\* 2014-12-02:
\* - Fix AppendEntries to only send one entry at a time, as originally
\*   intended. Since SubSeq is inclusive, the upper bound of the range should
\*   have been nextIndex, not nextIndex + 1. Thanks to Igor Kovalenko for
\*   reporting the issue.
\* - Change matchIndex' to matchIndex (without the apostrophe) in
\*   AdvanceCommitIndex. This apostrophe was not intentional and perhaps
\*   confusing, though it makes no practical difference (matchIndex' equals
\*   matchIndex). Thanks to Hugues Evrard for reporting the issue.
