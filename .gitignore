#
# To initialize a global gitignore which combines all of Github's per-language
# gitignore templates, run the following:
#
# (cd $(mktemp -d) &&
#   git clone https://github.com/github/gitignore . &&
#   git ls-files '*.gitignore' | xargs cat >> ~/.gitignore_global &&
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global)
