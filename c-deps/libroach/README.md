Code is formatted using [clang-format](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clang%20Format).

If `clang-format` is in your path, simple run `make c-deps-fmt` in your path to run it over
the `.cc` and `.h` files in libroach (excluding auto-generated proto files).

You may also want to add clang-format as a save hook in your editor.
