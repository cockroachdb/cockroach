/*
Package gossip implements a protocol for sharing information between
Cockroach nodes using an ad-hoc, peer-to-peer network. The
self-assembled network aims to minimize time for new information to
reach each node, and minimize network traffic required.

Gossiped information is identified by key. Gossip information is
captured by info objects. Info objects may be stored individually
(e.g. the number of nodes in the system), or may be organized into
groups (e.g. multiple values of the same type from different
originators).

Groups organize multiple instances of info for the same key
prefix. Groups come in two types: MinGroup groups keep only the
minimum values seen; MaxGroup groups keep only the maximum values
seen. An example is load or disk capacity values for nodes. In a
cluster with thousands of nodes, groups force the gossip network to
limit itself to only a portion of total data volume (e.g. the 100
least loaded nodes or the 100 disks with most unused capacity).

Single-valued info values can have any type. Values to be used with
groups must either be of type int64, float64, string or implement the
util.Ordered interface.

A map of info objects and a map of Group objects are kept by a Gossip
instance. Single-valued info objects can be added via
Gossip.AddInfo(). Groups must be registered via
Gossip.RegisterGroup(). Info objects are added to groups if their key
matches. Info can be queried for single-valued keys via
Gossip.GetInfo. Sorted values for groups are queried via
Gossip.GetGroupInfos().
