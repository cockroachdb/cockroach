logictest: add `force-backup-restore` directive

This directive can be added to a logictest to force
a cluster backup/restore before the execution of the next SQL
statement. This is independent of the `COCKROACH_LOGIC_TEST_BACKUP_RESTORE_PROBABILITY`
environment variable that can be set to randomly inject backup/restore
in a logictest.
