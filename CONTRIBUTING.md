Welcome to CockroachDB’s Hacktoberfest Project!

CockroachDB is participating in Hacktoberfest 2020 as a Community Partner. We invite you to contribute to CockroachDB regardless of your database or open source experience. You can work on code or documentation issues, or contribute apps to our sample apps repository. Whether you’re a new or experienced developer or tech writer, a seasoned contributor or new to open source, there’s something for everyone!

# What is Hacktoberfest?
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software organized by DigitalOcean, Intel, and DEV. Open four or more high-quality pull requests in October in any public repositories to get a limited edition Hacktoberfest T-shirt!

## What is CockroachDB?
CockroachDB is the distributed SQL database built to scale fast, survive anything, and thrive everywhere. Whether you are a single-person startup or a global enterprise, CockroachDB was designed to make managing data easy. To learn more about CockroachDB, see our [website](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) and [docs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/).

## How to participate?

1. Sign up on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
2. Look for issues in our [code](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach), [docs](https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs), and app repos with the label `Hacktoberfest` and assess the difficulty level that you’re keen to undertake.
3. Find an issue that looks interesting. For Docs and CockroachDB code, add a comment (“taking up this issue”) to the issue so other participants know the issue isn’t available anymore. For the sample app repo, it’s okay if multiple folks open PRs for the same issue. Y’all can make different versions of the same app idea!
4. Open a PR!
